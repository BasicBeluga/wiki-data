'''Industries''' are entities that produce specific [[en/Manual/Cargo]]s and/or services. There are three types of Industry in OpenTTD; Primary, Secondary and Tertiary. Primary industries, such as mines, provide goods without requiring anything. These resources are then transported by a [[en/Manual/Transport company|transport company]] to a Secondary Industry. Sometimes, Secondary Industries will provide a resource that will either be transported to Towns (goods or food), or to a Tertiary industry. 

'''Your company only transports goods. Therefore, you do not get profit from the goods, but just get paid for transporting them.'''

==Government Regulation==
Industries are governed by a [[en/Manual/Local authority|local authority]].

==Funding New Industries==
It is possible for a transport company to fund the construction a new industry, which will take place when and where you indicate. However, you won't get any immediate return on your investment (such as profit share) except the added cargo to transport. You don't own the facility that you create. 

Several patches change the rules of building new industries.

==Prospecting New Industries==
{{en/Nightly}}
In latest nightly builds of OpenTTD, you can ''prospect'' new industries. Funding new industries and prospecting one have two major differences; you cannot set the place for your industry, game will place industry for you. Second difference is that prospecting works only in primary industries, and you can change this feature in-game from patch settings window ''economy'' tab, ''Manual primary industry constructing method'' which can be on three settings: ''none'', ''as other industries'' and ''prospecting'' (default).
