You can also use path signals for these double entrances. The top one has space for a train to wait within the design, but if a train is waiting on the left branch and a station opens on the right branch, the train is stuck similarly to if you use block signals when you should use pre-signals. 

The bottom design allows the train to enter any station, regardless of which one opens first. There is also no point to making this design as long as your trains, as your train will have to wait at the first PBS anyways.

Note that both tracks are entry-tracks. I did not build exit tracks for this example.
