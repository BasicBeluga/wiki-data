In this case study of Airline Route Management we will explore a situation where there is one city, no destination.  A pure simple examinaiton of the type of aircraft needed to provide economical service to this airport and city.

== City Information ==

Population = 900

Maximum Passengers = 850

Maximum Mail = 200


== Airport Information ==

Population of City within Catchment Area = 400

Mail aviable in City winin Catchment Area = 50

== Analysis ==

Given that this information is on a per month basis we can make the following educated guess about the passenger volume at the airport. 

Every Month there will be 400 passengers and 50 tons of mail at the airport.  With no desintation and no distance to the other airport it is impossible to determine what kind of aircraft would best serve this airport.  A generalization could be made that any combination of aircraft which can carry 400 passengers and 50 tons of mail per year would be the most economical, although furthure case studies will explore the situation in more depth.
