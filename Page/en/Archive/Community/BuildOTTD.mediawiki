== Welcome ==
Welcome to BuildOTTD.<br>
BuildOTTD is a small program made for windows that makes it easy to download and compile the OTTD source with or without a patch.
This makes it an ideal tool for the casual playtester.

== Obtaining BuildOTTD ==
You can download BuildOTTD here: [http://rapidshare.com/files/31876033/SetupBuildOTTD.exe.html SetupBuildOTTD.exe] (~12Mb)

== Installing ==
Simply run the setup file and answer the question given to the best of your ability.<br>
If you accept all defaults there should be no trouble.
{{en/Warning|Always choose a path without spaces in it.<br> This is a limitation in the underlying tools used by BuildOTTD.}}

== OK, then what? ==
When you start the program you will see a window like this:<br>
<center>[[File:en/BuildOTTD1.png]]</center><br>
Now this might be very confusing at first but all you need to do to get the latest source and compile it, is to press the "Update and Compile" button.<br>
If all went well you should be able to find the result in the "builds" folder of the directory where you installed BuildOTTD.
