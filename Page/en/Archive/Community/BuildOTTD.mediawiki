BuildOTTD is a small program made for windows that makes it easy to download and compile the OTTD source with or without a patch.
This makes it an ideal tool for the casual playtester.

== Obtaining BuildOTTD ==
You can download BuildOTTD here: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/bottd/ Sourceforge] (~12Mb)

== Installing ==
Simply run the setup file and answer the questions given to the best of your ability.
If you accept all defaults there should be no trouble.
{{en/Warning|'''Always choose a path without spaces in it.'''<br>
This is a limitation in the underlying tools used by BuildOTTD.}}

When you first load the program you need to go to the settings and 
<center>[[File:en/BuildOTTD1.png|The settings screen]]</center>

== OK, then what? ==
When you start the program you will see a window like this:
<center>[[File:en/BuildOTTD1.png]]</center>
Now this might be very confusing at first but all you need to do to get the latest source and compile it, is to press the "Update and Compile" button.
If all went well you should be able to find the result in the "My Documents\My OTTD Builds" folder.
