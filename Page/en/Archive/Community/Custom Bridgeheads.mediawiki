Custom Bridgeheads are, conceptually, quite a simple idea.  The feature allows a flat bridgehead (a bridgehead being one end of a bridge) to act as any normal piece of track, such that it can host junctions and signals.  Note the word '''flat''' -- just as an inclined piece of track can not be "junctioned", neither can an inclined bridgehead.
