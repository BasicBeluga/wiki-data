This FAQ covers troubleshooting errors of [[en/Manual/Main Page]].

__FORCETOC__
=====I cannot start the game, it complains about missing files?=====
:* *Nix style OS's (Linux, OSX, Morhops, etc.)<br/>If you get an error like ''Error: Cannot open file '/usr/share/games/openttd/data/sample.cat' '', that means that you are missing files. Since currently OpenTTD is using the original TTDLX data files, you will need to copy those to your OpenTTD ''data/'' directory. This means all '''"*.grf"''' files (trg1r.grf, trgcr.grf, trghr.grf, trgir.grf and trgtr.grf) and '''"sample.cat"'''.
:* Windows OS (Win98, Win2k, WinXP, etc.)<br/>An error message window pops up informing you ''Cannot open file '<OpenTTD Install Directory>\data\sample.cat' '', that means that you are missing some files. Installing OpenTTD with the attached installer will ask you for your your TTDLX data files directory (usually the CD), and copy those files appropiately. If you are not using the installer, you need to do the same as for *nix systems.
=====Debugging your errors=====
:* In the case of errors you might try to run the game in debug mode. Run the game with the ''"-d1"'' flag in that case. Read more in the [[en/Development/Debugging]] wiki.
=====The game crashes on Win98(SE)=====
:* Windows98/98SE has problems with DirectX and DirectMusic. Try to start the game with: <pre>openttd.exe -m win32</pre>
=====When I start game in fullscreen mode, the refreshrate is changed to 60Hz! (Windows)=====
:*It's because you haven't configured DirectX properly. Try to download "DirectX Control Panel" from microsoft.com, copy it into /windows/system32, open the dialog in the Control Panel, go to DirectDraw tab, and set the "Forced Refresh Rate" to the maximum what your monitor can show.
=====I'm getting an error that MD5 of <filename> is ****INCORRECT**** - File Corrupt.=====
:*This error comes about if you have a corrupt or changed GRF file. It only checks the ones for the original TTD game, either DOS or Windows version, and if it finds that the file is corrupted, it presents this message. You should copy the file from your original TTD disk again.
:*This message will also appear if you are using modified GRF files (but only if they modify the original TTD files.  Other GRF's are not checked for corruption. The message was incorporated to make sure that any problems within the game are caused by the error you report rather than corrupt files on the disk.
=====When loading an older game my airports are screwed=====
:* If you have used some [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build]] in the early era of development of larger airports, some of the indexes could be messed up. Again, this only applies if you have used nightly builds. Official releases cannot have this problem. Copy the code below somewhere to your OpenTTD source and call the function once. Most problems should be fixed. It could be that you only have a subproblem, eg. not all are faulty, then you need to filter on ''st->index'' (easiest to get by going to station_gui.c line 396 (''"ScrollMainWindowToTile(DEREF_STATION(w->window_number)->xy);"''), setting a breakpoint there. ''"w->window_number"'' is the index of the station.
