__NOTOC__
Answers to frequently asked questions and problems with replacement graphics in OpenTTD.  For more information on NewGRF, including advanced options, see [[en/Manual/NewGRF]].

===How do I get different graphics into my OpenTTD? (installation)===
See the section on how to play with [[en/Manual/NewGRF]].

===A .grf file I downloaded causes errors, or keeps OpenTTD from running altogether.  Why?===

Not all .grf files will work with OpenTTD, as NewGRF is, at this stage of development, only partially supported.  Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing ahead of time which .grf files will work with OpenTTD and which will not.  The only way to tell is to install the .grf and begin playing.

===I’ve loaded the grf files into OpenTTD and loaded my saved game, but none of the new vehicle graphics I loaded appear.  How come?===

Any new games you begin will automatically use your newly installed .grf files.  Previously started games, however, require the following steps to include your new graphics:

# Open the OpenTTD console by hitting the ` key (key to the left of the "1" on most keyboards).
# Type in “resetengines"

Note that even after typing “resetengines", your pre-existing vehicles will still be of the old type.  However, you should now be able to build the new types of vehicles from any of your depots.

===I cannot change NewGRFs in my game, why?===
[[File:en/Archive/Community/Newgrf warning.png|frame|right|Warning when changing NewGRF Settings in a running game.]]

In version 1.1, changing NewGRFs in-game has been disabled. Ever since NewGRFs came to OpenTTD, changing them in existing saved games and scenarios was essentially broken. This has finally been fixed by disallowing changing NewGRFs in existing saved games (scenarios are technically saved games as well, so the limitation also applies to scenarios in the scenario editor). Please see [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=53881 this topic at tt-forums] for reasons why it is generally a bad idea to change NewGRFs in existing saved games and scenarios.

The reason behind this change is that too many people ignored the warning in the red error window, and complained about crashes, or problems with vehicles, industries, etc. after modifying the NewGRF Settings in a saved game.

For NewGRF developers, a configuration option exists to enable newgrf developer tools, which permit changing grfs in-game (for debugging and testing). This option (scenario_developer) is only available in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]] or the [[en/Manual/Console]]. If you decide to change this setting, please take time to actually read the warning message when presented. Also know that if your scenario or saved game gets messed up, the only solution is to start from scratch.

===Where can I find .GRF files for download?===

The 'bananas' site contains many NewGRFs, accessible from the [[en/Manual/Online content|online content]] button in the main menu.

Several sites have NewGRF files available for use in OpenTTD.

You should first visit the list of [[en/Community/NewGRF/Main Page|OpenTTD supported GRF files]], which contains files confirmed to work within OpenTTD.  After that, visit [[en/Archive/Lists/Links#graphics-links]], or check out these sites:
