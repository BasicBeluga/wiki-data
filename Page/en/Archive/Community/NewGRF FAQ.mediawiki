__NOTOC__
Answers to frequently asked questions and problems with replacement graphics in OpenTTD.  For more information on NewGRF, including advanced options, see [[en/Manual/NewGRF]].

===How do I get different graphics into my OpenTTD? (installation)===
See the section on how to play with [NewGRF].

===A .grf file I downloaded causes errors, or keeps OpenTTD from running altogether.  Why?===

Not all .grf files will work with OpenTTD, as NewGRF is, at this stage of development, only partially supported.  Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing ahead of time which .grf files will work with OpenTTD and which will not.  The only way to tell is to install the .grf and begin playing.

===I’ve loaded the grf files into OpenTTD and loaded my saved game, but none of the new vehicle graphics I loaded appear.  How come?===

Any new games you begin will automatically use your newly installed .grf files.  Previously started games, however, require the following steps to include your new graphics:

# Open the OpenTTD console by hitting the ` key (key to the left of the "1" on most keyboards).
# Type in “resetengines"

Note that even after typing “resetengines", your pre-existing vehicles will still be of the old type.  However, you should now be able to build the new types of vehicles from any of your depots.

===Where can I find .GRF files for download?===

Several sites have NewGRF files available for use in OpenTTD.  

You should first visit the list of [[en/Community/NewGRF/Main Page|OpenTTD supported GRF files]], which contains files confirmed to work within OpenTTD.  After that, visit [[en/Archive/Lists/Links#graphics-links]], or check out these sites:
