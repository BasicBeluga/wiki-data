Nightly builds allow you to play the latest (bleeding edge) version of the game that the developers are working on. They are already compiled into binary files (executables) so that the user does not need any knowledge of coding and compiling to play them.


==Description==
Nightly builds are versions of the game that are compiled and packaged every night (19:00 GMT) based upon the latest [[en/Development/FAQ development]] version. You may download them from http://nightly.openttd.org/.

Currently there are nightly builds for: 
*Windows (Win32)
*Linux (AMD64 / i386 / i686)
*MacOS (normal, Intel, PowerPC)
*MorphOS

You may also get previous nightly builds by following the links under the heading of '''Archive Builds''' on the same nightly web page.

==Bugs in the Nightly==
If you think you have found a bug download a copy of the latest nightly build (or compile a version yourself) and check if the bug still exists.

If the bug is still there, please '''first''' check the [http://http://www.tt-forums.net/index.php?c=20 forums] and [http://bugs.openttd.org/ OpenTTD's Flyspray web site (http://bugs.openttd.org/)] to make sure that the bug has yet to be reported.  If you cannot find a report, please make one on either or both the forum and the Flyspray site.

==Nightly build guidelines==
Since currently nightlies naming and their contents are a bit of a mess, below you will find the official guidelines for them.

===Name===
The name should uniformly identify the system type and for which revision the nightly was made.
:*OpenTTD: '''"OTTD-<system>-nightly-r<revision>.<extension>"'''. Eg ''OTTD-win32-nightly-r3794.zip''.
:*Strgen: '''"strgen-<system>.<extension>"'''. Eg ''strgen-win32.zip''.

===OpenTTD Changes===
OpenTTD itself should be changed so that it correctly reflects the nature of the nightly. This means adding the nightly tag as its identifier (already done on systems that use the makefile for compilation)
:*Revision: the current revision the nightly was made for, eg "r3794"
:*Title Bar: includes the name and revision of the program in the format '''OpenTTD (YYYY-MM-DD) - r<revision>'''
:*Executable properties (if applicable): if your system supports executable properties as on windows please change the following as close to the below guidelines:
:*FileVersion: current openttd version, eg 0.4.0.1
:*ProductVersion: current openttd version plus revision; eg '''"0.4.0.1 r<rev>"'''
:*SpecialBuild: show that this is a nightly: ''''"Nightly Build of YYYY-MM-DD"''''

===Compiling===
Compiling should be done without any DEBUG information (eg release mode) but with ASSERTIONS enabled. PNG and ZLIB have to be enabled as well.
