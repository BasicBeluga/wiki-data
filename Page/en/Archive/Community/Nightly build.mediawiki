[[Translation:en/Archive/Community/Nightly build]]
Nightly builds are versions of the game that are compiled and packaged every night (19:00 GMT) based upon the latest [[en/Development/FAQ development]] version. Currently there are nightly builds for Windows, Linux and Macintosh which you can get from [http://nightly.openttd.com/ nightly.openttd.com]. If you think you have found a bug download a copy of the latest nightly build (or compile a version yourself) and check if the bug still exists.
