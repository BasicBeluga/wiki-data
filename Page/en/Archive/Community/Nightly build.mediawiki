[[Translation:en/Archive/Community/Nightly build]]
Nightly builds are versions of the game that are compiled and packaged nightly based upon the latest [[en/Development/FAQ development]] version. Currently there are nightly builds for Windows, Linux and Macintosh which you can get from [http://openttd.rulez.org/download/nightlybuilds/ openttd.rulez.org]. If you think you have found a bug download a copy of the latest nightly build (or compile a version yourself) and check if the bug still exists.
