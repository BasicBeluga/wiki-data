Go to the top-left corner, there shulod be a menu called SystemGo to System -> Preferences -> AppearanceYou would probably want to select Normal or Extra on the Visual Effects tab(try it out, though it does require a faster graphics card(anything above 128MB shulod do fine with at least testing, not sure about 128MB itself)Under Theme, you just want to select a theme. Play around a little bit, you can also customize it if you want to.I have Ubuntu 10.04 myself and use it daily(for the past year)
