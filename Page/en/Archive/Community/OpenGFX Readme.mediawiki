'''OpenGFX''' is a set of [[en/Archive/Community/Base graphics]] for [[en/Manual/Main Page]] and is the result of the [[en/Archive/Community/Graphics Replacement|8bpp Graphics Replacement Project]].

OpenGFX is an open source replacement for the original TTD graphics used by OpenTTD. The main goal of OpenGFX therefore is to provide a set of free base graphics which make it possible to play OpenTTD without requiring the (copyrighted) files from the TTD cd. This potentially increases the OpenTTD fanbase and makes it a true free game (with "free" as in both "[https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/free beer free beer]" and "[https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/open source open source]").

The OpenGFX base graphics set is currently not complete yet, but is already very playable.

==Downloading OpenGFX==
OpenGFX is available from at least two locations. This readme will only cover the official download locations. We cannot support third party download locations and we cannot refund your money if you have paid money for OpenGFX.

* If you're new to OpenTTD and don't have access to the original TTD files, you'll have to follow the [[#installing-opengfx-manually|manual installation procedure]]. This is really not that difficult as it may sound, so don't worry too much about that.
* If you already have OpenTTD up and running using the original TTD base graphics, [[#installing-or-updating-opengfx-using-the-online-content-service|Installing OpenGFX using the Online Content service]] is the easy way to obtain OpenGFX.


==Installing OpenGFX Manually==
'''1.''' First, make sure that you [http://www.openttd.org/ downloaded] and [[en/Manual/Installation|installed]] at least '''OpenTTD version 0.7.0''' or a recent [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build]].

'''2.''' Next, download the latest OpenGFX package from http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opengfx/files/.

'''3.''' Place the [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar (file format) tar file] into the OpenTTD /data directory. There's no need to unpack the tar, so just leave it as it is.
Your OpenTTD /data directory is either located in:
* An OpenTTD folder in your user account's home directory:
** Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\My Documents\OpenTTD
** Mac OSX: ~/Documents/OpenTTD
** Linux:   ~/.openttd
* The OpenTTD installation directory.

'''4.''' Run OpenTTD. Chances are that you'll get an error about a missing 'sample.cat' file. If that is the case, follow the steps in the [[#sample-cat-error|sample.cat error section]] first before continuing here.

'''5.''' In the main menu of the game, click the ''Game Options'' button. The ''Game Options'' dialog will appear.

'''6.''' Select ''OpenGFX'' from the drop-down list below ''Base graphics set'' if that's not selected already (bottom left of window). Close the window using the &times; in the upper left corner.
* If you did not install the original TTD base graphics during the installation of OpenTTD, you can skip this step.
* If you installed the original TTD base graphics as well, this is where you can switch base graphic sets.

Now that wasn't so hard, was it? Anyways, if you're having trouble getting OpenGFX to work, please file a detailed report on what you did, what error messages you got and where you got stuck in the OpenGFX release topic at TT-forums: http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=40162

===Sample.cat error===
The sample.cat file contains the sound effects from the original TTD. OpenTTD requires that file to be installed correctly, otherwise the game will not start. What to do if you don't have that file? Read on! The solution is to create a dummy sample.cat file.

'''1.''' Browse to the OpenTTD /data directory.
* See step 3 of [[#installing-opengfx-manually|Installing OpenGFX Manually]] on where to find that directory.

'''2.''' Create an empty file with ''sample.cat'' as file name:
* Use your operating system's built in graphical tools, or;
* Use a command like ''$ touch sample.cat'' on the command line, or;
* Alternatively download an empty sample.cat file (http://www.openttdcoop.org/sample.cat) and place it in the OpenTTD /data directory.

'''Note:''' If you have the dummy sample.cat file in place the game still will give you an error about the file being corrupted. The difference this time is that you now ''do'' have an option to start the game: just click OK to continue!

==Installing or Updating OpenGFX using the Online Content service==
This method uses the [[en/Manual/Online content]] service to download OpenGFX. In order to use this, you need a working OpenTTD and again at least '''OpenTTD version 0.7.0''' or a recent [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build]].

'''1.''' Start OpenTTD and on the main menu click the ''Check online content'' button. A new window will pop up.
* If OpenTTD doesn't start, follow the [[#installing-opengfx-manually|manual installation procedure]].

'''2.''' Find the OpenGFX entry from the list at the left. You can use the search box in the upper right corner of the window.

'''3.''' Click the little square in front of the OpenGFX entry in order to mark it for download.

'''4.''' Click the ''Download'' button in the bottom right corner. After download, close the open windows.

'''5.''' In the main menu of the game, click the ''Game Options'' button. The ''Game Options'' dialog will appear.

'''6.''' Select ''OpenGFX'' from the drop-down list below ''Base graphics set'' if that's not selected already (bottom left of window). Close the window using the &times; in the upper left corner.
* This is where you can switch base graphic sets.


==Project status==
OpenGFX is not completely finished yet and some graphics still are missing. 

The current status of the project can be found at the [[en/Archive/Community/Graphics Replacement|Graphics Replacement Tracking Table]].


==Reporting bugs==
{{en/Note|Missing graphics show up in the game as black rectangles. Please don't report these black rectangles as bugs.}}

If you do spot any grapical bugs or glitches in the available graphics, please let us know! There are two ways to report bugs:
* Via the Issue Tracker: http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opengfx/issues. You have to register there in order to submit a bugreport. This is also the place to check what bugs already have been reported or to check what's fixed or new for the next release.
* Via the OpenGFX release topic at TT-forums.net: http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=40162.


Either way, make sure the bugreport is useful. Provide as much information you can!
