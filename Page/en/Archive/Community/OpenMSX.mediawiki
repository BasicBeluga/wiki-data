== Technical Details ==

The music files are MIDI files conforming to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI General MIDI] standard, with an extension of .gm instead of .mid. The files are placed in the /gm folder, either in the base install for OpenTTD, or in the common installation folder. The game links to the music files with a .obm text file which contains the filename, the title, and an MD5 checksum for each file, along with other metadata not displayed in the game. A maximum of 31 MIDI files can be included in each pack - one title track that is played when the game starts, and 30 other tracks divided into the classic 'Transport Tycoon Deluxe' categories of Old Style, New Style and Ezy Street.  

== Licensing ==

At this time the license the project will work with is under discussion. Proposed licenses include GNU Public License v.2 and Creative Commons Sampling+ 1.0.  

== How to Participate ==

All users who are capable of creating MIDI music are encouraged to participate in the program. The traditional style of music used in TTD was blues and jazz. At this time the project is open to all submissions of any style for consideration. Additionally, if you know of a composer who develops MIDI music and may be willing to participate, such submissions are also open to consideration. Discussion is currently ongoing as to which styles will be used.

== Progress ==

The Music replacement project (MRP) has not started development yet, but plans are being made. Several users have volunteered to use the original TTD music as inspiration for new tracks, since the originals cannot simply be re-recorded or used due to lack of licensing and sampling clearance. There will be a maximum of 31 tracks included in the core MRP. More MRP packs may become available in the future.
