[[Translation:en/Archive/Community/OpenTTD Updaters]]
The general idea of an an Updater is that it is a program that runs before openttd.exe which checks if there is a newer nightly available and if so it may ask the user if it wants to upgrade and if so it downloads the newer nightly and installs it. After the installation is done openttd.exe is executed and the game starts as normal. 

For OpenTTD there exist more than one updating program. Some of them are listed below.
