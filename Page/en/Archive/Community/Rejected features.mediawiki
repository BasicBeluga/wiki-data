| 1 ||Automatically download NewGRFs
||If you join a server OpenTTD automatically download the missing newgrf||There are copyright related issues which cannot be solved for automatic downloads of newgrfs. The author may not want that their files are automatically downloaded. Some newgrf releases contains readme and licence files which may be not downloaded through such a system ([http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=602814#p602814 michael blunck's post]). A flag in the newgrf itself doesn't solve the problem as this flag could be easily changed in the file to circumvent the protection.||-||* Thread: [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=32764 Downloadable Graphics from servers?]

| 2 ||Multithread/Multicore support
||Adding support for multiple threads and using more than one CPU in a multi core environment||The game use only one thread for the game engine to make it deterministic what happends. Implementing such a feature will desync in multiplayer all the time.||-||* Thread: [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=37064 Multi-core support please!]

| 3 ||Undo
||An undo feature/button to undo the last (1 to N) actions||As the game is running all the time (and is not an office application) its not possible to "undo" something as if it didn't happen. Especially on a network game the command is already sent to the clients, money is already spent, land is already terraformed, and so on. If you really want an undo feature use (auto)save.||-||* Thread: [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=38377 PLEASE GOD make an undo last feature]
