[[Translation:en/Archive/Community/Requested features]]

This is a list of all discussed suggestions that may or may not make it into the game. If you think you have a new suggestion, '''please post it first on the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=32 forums]''' but first search the forum as this wiki page does not list all suggestions. You'll get more feedback there and if a lot of people like it, you can still put it here.

Looking for something to do?  Write a [[en/Development/Main Page|patch]] for one of these features!

Requested features that have already been rejected by the OpenTTD developers are marked as '''Rejected'''. Please do ''not'' request those features here or in the forums again. The reasons why a feature was rejected and further information can be found under [[en/Archive/Community/Rejected features]].

#Ensure you are playing the latest [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build]] version of the game so that you know what's already been done.
#Post your idea on the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=32 suggestions forum].
#Wait a day or so for feedback. You may discover that it is already part of something else, or get ideas on how to improve your suggestion.
#Post your idea here, in the most appropriate category, in alphabetical order, '''with a link to the forum discussion'''.  Development forum threads are preferable to suggestion forum threads.
#Choose a progress from the list below.
#:0% - No code written
#:10% - Minor amount of work on this suggestion
#:50% - Moderate amount work, but not near completion.
#:75% - Nearing completion, but still under development.
#:90% - Code is technically complete and functionality changes are not likely.
#:100% - Feature part of the trunk (please indicate which revision this happened in).
#:unknown - Suspected/known that the OpenTTD Devs are working on the feature, but they aren't telling anyone about their progress.
#:rejected - '''The idea itself''' has been rejected by the OpenTTD Devs.
#:not needed - The idea itself is not specifically rejected, but thereis something else you can use so Devs won't bother with it
#Try to follow the page format, using the {{en/S|en/Archive/Community/Rf}} template.  If this format does not work, improve it!
#'''Do not create a separate article for your suggestion. It will be deleted.'''
#'''Do not create a suggestion that has already been rejected. [[en/Archive/Community/Rejected features]] stay in this list, but with a "rejected" note instead of the percentage.
#If you can, write a patch for your suggestion!
