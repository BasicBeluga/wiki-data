Welcome to the [[en/Community/Scenarios/Scenarios Team]] ToDo list. Here is a list of the many things we need to work on in relation to the [[en/Community/Scenarios/Scenarios Team|scenarios project]].

== Instructions ==

When a scenario has been found please add it to the first category. For these the creator needs to be contacted (please place a "C" next to it to notify that they have been contacted). Those with permission granted please move to the second category. When a scenario has been added please remove from the page. The scenarios that we are not allowed to add should be moved to the third category. Any work that is planned or ongoing to do with the database should be placed in the 4th category. Additionally, any work/threads in the forum should be added.
