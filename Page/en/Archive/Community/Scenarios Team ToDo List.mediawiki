Welcome to the [[en/Community/Scenarios/Scenarios Team]] ToDo list. Here is a list of the many things we need to work on in relation to the [[en/Community/Scenarios/Scenarios Team|scenarios project]].

== Instructions ==

When a scenario has been found please add it to the first category. For these the creator needs to be contacted (see below for standard message and please place a "C" next to it to notify that they have been contacted). Those with permission granted please move to the second category. When a scenario has been added please remove from the page. The scenarios that we are not allowed to add should be moved to the third category. Any work that is planned or ongoing to do with the database should be placed in the 4th category. Additionally, any work/threads in the forum should be added.

Dear <enter name>,

We, the Scenarios Team on the OTTD Wiki, would like to be able to add your scenario (<enter scenario name>) to our database. It is a new way of searching and storing scenarios. If you could reply to this message with either:

I give you permission to add <enter scenario name> to your database. Signed <enter name>

Or: I do not give you permission to add <enter scenario name> to your database. Signed <enter name>

Or any other response that you feel necessary. You may reserve the right to remove your permission at any point, just please contact one of us on the Scenarios Team or leave a message on the talk page. You do not have to add it yourself, though you are welcome. If you would like to provide a description please incluse that in your reply.

Thank you
