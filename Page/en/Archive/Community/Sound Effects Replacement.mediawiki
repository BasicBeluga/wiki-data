[[Translation:en/Archive/Community/Sound Effects Replacement]]
{{en/Note|This project is not yet finalised. Please see the forums for more information (see External Links below).}}

==Technical and licensing details==

Sounds should be uploaded as 44,100Hz, 16-bit mono WAV or FLAC files. There will be a new sound file format developed for OpenTTD, likely using .tar files in a manner similar to that of the new graphics. Until then, tools will be made available to enable work to go on using the existing sample.cat format.

For ensuring that resulting sample.cat (or tar) file may be distributed freely with OpenTTD code all sound files must have some of free license. Appropriate are [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public domain Public domain] or the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/ Sampling Plus license]. Other licenses (like for example Creative Commons -sa -nd -nc or its combinations) are more problematic. If sourcing sound effects from free libraries online, please ensure they are licenced under Public domain or the Sampling Plus 1.0 license.

== Progress ==
Progress can be followed using the [http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opensfx/roadmap roadmap]. At this moment only 12 of the 74 samples need to be done.
