Below is a list of problems, issues with the game that have to be fixed. Fixing these have been put off for now, because for example too much work, waiting for total recode, etc. Als see all <i>FIXME</i>'s in the code. If some seem easy to fix, please do so.

*<b>Animated sprites</b> - Animated sprites, such as the turning radar on an airport are utter crappily coded. Needs a whole rework of the graphics code.
*<b>Airports</b> - Airportlayout should be saved in Airport struct. Will be fixed when plugin-interface is done and stuff can be moved there.  Also move airport-year-availability to external airport stuff. Increase chances of crashing of airplanes not only for small airports but also configureable by airport type. Needs above said plugin system to be saved with external airport data. Sort out function to get new airport type.
*<b>Better Vehicle by Cargo-sorter</b>.
*<b>Flip ascending/descending</b> sort of industries for production/transported stuff
*Loading of old <b>exclusive rights</b> stuff and moving it to towns.
*<b>Spritecache issues</b>. What to do when a user renames a file, it cannot be loaded, or changes order? Put off until newgrf is seriously looked at, right now it would be just ugly patching.
*The whole <b>newgrf</b> thing needs to be refined. You can read what exactly is being done in the [[en/NewGRF TODO]].
