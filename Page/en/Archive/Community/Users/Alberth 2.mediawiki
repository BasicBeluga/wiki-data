* switch syntax
* managing IDs (yak-shaving)
* constant substitution
* templating
* file inclusion

Perhaps add scope: "scope(FEAT_ROADVEH) { .... }"  where all names in the scope are local to that scope. This solves "ID management" for a large part.
Constant substitution can be done with "const edibles_cargoes = ['FRUT', 'WATR'];    self.label_refits_allowed = edible_cargoes;"
