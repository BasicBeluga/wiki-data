Leave a note in the discussion session or leave a note on [[en/Development/IRC channel]] (I'm usually hanging on the channels #openttd and #openttdcoop)

Note that my nick is avdg and not avd. The change in my nick happened when all accounts had to switch on a centralised account, I really can not remember what happened there.
