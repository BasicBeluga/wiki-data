I am Chris Jones, a dude living near Wrexham, in North Wales. I eat, sleep, breathe, and do more things. I make graphics for Transport Tycoon at my website, and some of them are currently being re-jigged.

I've recently been made a SysOp here, (thanks MiHaMiX) so if you have any queries or need anything done, don't hesitate to ask me on my talk page.

I like GRF sets, and am a big fan and user of the [[en/Community/NewGRF/UK Renewal Set]] and [[en/Community/NewGRF/Aviators Aircraft Set]] sets of [[en/Archive/Community/Users/PikkaBird]] origin.
