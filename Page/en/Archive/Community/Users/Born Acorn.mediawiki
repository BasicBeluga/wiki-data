I am Chris Jones, a dude living near Wrexham, in North Wales. I eat, sleep, breath, and do more things. I make graphics for Transport Tycoon at my website, and some of them are currently being re-jigged.

A big fan of the [[en/Community/NewGRF/UK Renewal Set]] and [[en/Community/NewGRF/Aviators Aircraft Set]] of Pikkabird origin.
