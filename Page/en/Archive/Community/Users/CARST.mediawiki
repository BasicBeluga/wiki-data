Some general information regarding my scenarios:
- Updated regulary for changes or new builds of TTD (but old versions should still work).
- Actual version "v3" of all scenarios.
- Besides the training- and mega-scenario i try to base all my scenarios on NASA SRTM-Data and try to include lakes, rivers and a good number of towns. Because the world-scnerio was to large for merged DEMs from SRTM (read or i would have to scale them down too much) i just a geographical height map, that should be very realistic, too.
- I use some GRFs (grafics enhancements) in all maps, that are DBSetXL, GermanTramSet, NewStations, PlaneSet.
- You should be able to play all scenarios without these GRFs, but i will provide a zip- download containing all four. All rights stay at their coders and if one coder has a problem with me redistributing his work please contact me.
