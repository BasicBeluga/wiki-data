Some general information regarding my scenarios:<br>
- Updated regulary for changes or new builds of TTD (but old versions should still work).<br>
- Actual version "v3" of all scenarios.<br>
- Besides the training- and mega-scenario i try to base all my scenarios on NASA SRTM-Data and try to include lakes, rivers and a good number of towns. Because the world-scnerio was to large for merged DEMs from SRTM (read or i would have to scale them down too much) i just a geographical height map, that should be very realistic, too.<br>
- I use some GRFs (grafics enhancements) in all maps, that are DBSetXL, GermanTramSet, NewStations, PlaneSet.<br>
- You should be able to play all scenarios without these GRFs, but i will provide a zip- download containing all four. All rights stay at their coders and if one coder has a problem with me redistributing his work please contact me.<br>
- GRFs used in my scnarios, download link: [http://web1.delta234.server4you.de/diverses/openttd/grfs.zip Download]<br>
- All my scenario downloads include a version to start in 1920 and one to start in 1950.<br>
- more to come...<br>
