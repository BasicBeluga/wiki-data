=Darkvater - OpenTTD Developer=


==Who am I?==
Darkvater is one of the first developers to has joined the [[en/Manual/Main Page]] project. After making one of the first patches, called ''build on slopes'', with a lot of help from [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Ludde]], his biggest contribution has been the adding of new airports, and a completely reworked and flexible airport movement scheme.

Since then he can regularly be found in #openttd fixing bugs, applying patches and generally being there. He also supplies the [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build]] for the Windows environment.

==His first words==
Darkvater has joined the project on Friday the 12th of March 2004 at 13:28:44, only a week after the announcement of the project on the TT-Forums. His by now famous words were (trying to get build-on-slopes to work):

<pre>(Darkvater) hi guys
(ludde) hi
(Darkvater) damn, it's a pain in the ass following what that program does :)</pre>
