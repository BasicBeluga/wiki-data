What's this? Oh right, a page about me. Let's see, what should should I put in here?!


First, let me thank all OpenTTD developers, all NewGRF developers and all other contributers for making this wonderful game even better, ever day!

== (O)TTD and Me ==
I'm playing TTDX on and off ever since I got the game as a christmas present, that must have been 1999. Four years ago I got myself a laptop computer running XP. I was very disappointed when I discovered that TTDX didn't run on the damn thing, so I kept playing the game on my parents desktop which still ran Win98 back then; and TTDX ;)
Some months after I got that laptop, a friend of mine pointed my nose into the right direction. The OpenTTD direction! And I'm playing it ever since. I should be able to find out the exact date I started playing OpenTTD, because the installer I used back then should be somewhere on my hard drive. I'll look into that later...

== TT-Forums and Me ==
On the 21st of May 2007 I registered at [http://www.tt-forums.net TT-Forums] after lurking for several months. I don't know what my first post was back then, but it's probably something stupid as in 'did I register just to say that?'. Anyways, after some time I felt I needed to contribute to the game and the community. There were several options: donate money; play the game even more; do something creative. I chose the latter, and started creating [[en/Manual/NewGRF]].

== NewGRF and Me ==
After doing some minor things, basically figuring out what NewGRF was about, I started creating a new type of tram tracks: [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=605580#p605580 New Tram Tracks]. After that, I got involved in the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=609644#p609644 Dutch Tram Set] project, became the main coder for the project and even drew some vehicles myself. I didn't consider myself a graphics artist at that time. Not too long ago, I came up with the idea of a Maglev track replace set: the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=638985#p638985 Transrapid Track Set]. It's still a WIP project. Just recently I got involved in the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=35310 Graphics Replacement Project]; and I'm currently drawing [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=653713#p653713 New Stations] for the project.

Apart from those major projects, I did some initial coding to get other people started, most notably the Modern Tram Set. I also released a bugfix version of Kolijn Wolfaardt's New Terrain.
