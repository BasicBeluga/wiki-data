What's this? Oh right, a page about me. Let's see, what should should I put in here?!

First, let me thank all OpenTTD developers, all NewGRF developers and all other contributers for making this wonderful game even better, ever day!

== (O)TTD and Me ==
I'm playing TTDX on and off ever since I got the game as a christmas present, that must have been 1999. Four years ago I got myself a laptop computer running XP. I was very disappointed when I discovered that TTDX didn't run on the damn thing, so I kept playing the game on my parents desktop which still ran Win98 back then; and TTDX ;)
Some months after I got that laptop, a friend of mine pointed my nose into the right direction. The OpenTTD direction! And I'm playing it ever since. I should be able to find out the exact date I started playing OpenTTD, because the installer I used back then should be somewhere on my hard drive. I'll look into that later...
{{en/Note|Note to self: figure out when I started playing OTTD.}}
== TT-Forums and Me ==
On the 21st of May 2007 I registered at [http://www.tt-forums.net TT-Forums] after lurking for several months. I don't know what my first post was back then, but it's probably something stupid as in 'did I register just to say that?'. Anyways, after some time I felt I needed to contribute to the game and the community. There were several options: donate money; play the game even more; do something creative. I chose the latter, and started creating [[en/Manual/NewGRF]].

== NewGRF and Me ==
After doing some minor things, basically figuring out what NewGRF was about, I started creating a new type of tram tracks: New Tram Tracks. After that, I got involved in the Dutch Tram Set project, became the main coder for the project and even drew some vehicles myself. I didn't consider myself a graphics artist at that time. Not too long ago, I came up with the idea of a Maglev track replace set: the Transrapid Track Set. It's still a WIP project. Just recently I got involved in the Graphics Replacement Project; I've drawn the New Stations for the project.

Apart from those major projects, I did some initial coding to get other people started, most notably the Modern Tram Set. I also released a bugfix version of Kolijn Wolfaardt's New Terrain.

'''About FooBar'''

At some point in time, everyone needs to have a nickname. When that time came for me, I didn't know what to pick. That wasn't because I had a lot of options to choose from! The exact reason why I eventually picked `FooBar`, is explained in the very first line of the Wikipedia article [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/foobar None], I quote: "''The term foobar is a common placeholder name also referred to as metasyntactic variable used in computer programming or computer related documentation''".

'''About the person behind FooBar'''

Born in 1987, I grew up in a small town in the south of the Netherlands. Currently, I study Civil Engineering at [http://www.tudelft.nl/ Delft University of Technology]. I spend most of my free time on computer related stuff, mostly OpenTTD and creating websites (for which I often use the PHP programming language, so Foo and Bar were not too unfamiliar to me!).

Thanks for reading!
