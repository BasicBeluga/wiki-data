Hello :)
I'm GoneWacko, a male from The Netherlands, born in 1988 (you do the maths if you want to know my age... I'm not going to update this page every year)

I love TTD and TTDPatch.
At first I was a bit unsure about OpenTTD. But over time I have come to like it, especially since 0.3.5 introduced stable network support.
It was on 2nd January 2005 that I wrote my first patch for OpenTTD: The 'Create Lake' tool for the scenario editor.
I plan to do more work for OpenTTD and in the process learn the ins and outs of C (Although I was advised not to do so do so (with OpenTTD at least)).
I am pretty new to C though.

==Modifications==
So far, I have created the following patches/modifications/features/experiments:
:29th December 2005: When I was very bored I decided to download the OpenTTD source (under Linux) and play around with it. After some time I had a new button in the Main Menu that opened a window with nothing in it. (Clicking the window somehow stopped the title screen game to stop :P) Because this was just an experiment and completely useless this was never submitted to the devteam.
:2nd January 2005: I created the 'Create Lake' tool for the Scenario Editor, making it easier to create a lake or sea. I hated the fact that the only way to create a lake or sea was to flood the area from an existing pool of water by digging a ditch, and afterwards removing the ditch again. This tool simply creates a water tile (as long as the tile is at sealevel (at least until the MapRewrite is done) that afterwards floods the region.

==Working on:==
I'm still doing some very simple patches to get a feel for the code.
I am currently trying to make the 'Create Desert' tool in the scenario editor a draggable tool, but this is made harder because of a Segmentation Fault occuring whenever one loads a Desert Terrain map.
I am also trying some more stuff for the Create Lake tool.
