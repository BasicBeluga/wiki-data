'''Hackykid''' was an OpenTTD [[en/Archive/Community/Developers|developer]] responsible for features such as articulated engines and signal GUI (which never made it to trunk).

He worked on improved [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] support, improving it from where [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Pasky]] had left off.

Hackykid is no longer an active developer, although he can sometimes be seen on the IRC channel, #openttd.
