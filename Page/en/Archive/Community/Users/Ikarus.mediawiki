=My OpenTTD Suggestions=
Here are some of my suggestions for OpenTTD, currently only for personal reference

==Gameplay==
#AI assistant
#* AI tasked with creating routes & vehicles (Human builds infrastructure)
#option to switch between ''TTD mode'' and ''OpenTTD mode''
#* these should be configuration presets
#* OpenTTD mode should be what the developers/community consider to be best (e.g. realistic acceleration)
#shares bought in competing companies should add to company value (% of shares * company value)

==Construction==
#build town roads
#* cheaper than private roads (since subsidized)
#shared road depots
#towns buy company-owned roads when inside inner city limits (area inside "tree circle")
#right-click de-selects current tool
#remove [[en/Manual/Building depots|Depot orientation]] window
#* orientation automatic when possible
#* orientation set by dragging to edge (depot displayed but not placed)
#advanced [[en/Manual/Landscaping#autoslope|Autoslope]], adding ability to raise/lower constructions

==Interface==
#advanced configuration in tab, not tree view for Interface, Construction ...
#vehicle capacities summed (not separate for every railcar)
#a single shortcut key for removal of objects (i.e. like CTRL+placement tool, e.g. CTRL+Autorail vs. R for signals)
#alternate raise/lower ground by holding (e.g.) ALT key
#selecting "railway construction" automatically selects the [[en/Archive/Manual/Autorail]] tool
#station window should display "Supplies: ..." below "Accepts: ..."
#autmatically sort vehicle lists by cargo type
#*alternatively, setting up filters (e.g. if train has passenger carriage -> assign to group "passenger train")
#manage railcars from [[en/Manual/Vehicle lists]]
#* e.g. build a Passenger Carriage and drag it to Train 12. This will instruct the train to go to a depot and have the railcar added
#* likewise moving railcars on train set

==Other==
I'm not so sure how these suggestions might alter the feel of TT, so I singled them out for now
#ability to invest in vehicle research, so, e.g. Maglev would be available sooner
#ability to build platforms
#*similar to bridges, but tile by tile
#*the size of a tile
#*anything can be built on them, even diagonally (maybe even stations, i.e. multi-level stations)
#*default surface: concrete (foundation texture)
