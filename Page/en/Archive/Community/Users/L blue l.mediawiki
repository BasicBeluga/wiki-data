Hi I'm Blue.

I am an OpenTTD enthusiast and have been making patches on and off for OpenTTD from the start of 2006.  I have sadly not finished any of my works yet but I have learnt a lot and will hopefully be able to finish one of my projects soon.   

I will add a link to some links to my projects I have been working on in the coming days.
