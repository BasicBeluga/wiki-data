My first (and so far only) patch for OpenTTD is called [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=44543 Cargo backup/restore for vehicle renewals].

I also posted a slightly updated version of pavel1269's [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=42432 Another Daylength patch] which I find a very good and important feature, but I'm still hoping that Pavel will continue its development himself.
