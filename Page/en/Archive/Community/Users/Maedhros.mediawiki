Maedhros' first patch was a rather major one, as it allowed level crosings on diagonal track, which as of yet hasn't been committed to trunk. 

Currently, he is working with [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Belugas]] to complete [[en/Archive/Manual/NewGRF Houses]] "Newhouses", which will allow NewGRF sets such as the [[en/Total Town Replacement Set]] by Zimmlock to work in the game. Newhouses has been stated by Belugas to be close to compeltion.

Maedhros was given commit access to the newhouses branch, and has since become a full developer, being accepted into the OpenTTD developer group on TT-Forums.
