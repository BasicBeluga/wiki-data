I'm 17 years old guy from Poland. I'm sysop on this Wiki. Just don't spam with cheap medicines and we'll get on well :)

I've made ''no tunnels under mines/shafts'' and ''drag and drop rocky surfaces'' patches for OTTD

digraph "testing" {

	node [style=filled fillcolor="#66CCFFFF" shape = "invhouse" fontname "Arial"]

rankdir = "LR"

"MeusH" -> "da cool man"
"MeusH" -> "lol"
"lol" -> "funny"
"funny" -> "cool"

"cool" -> "da cool man"
