I'm 16 years old guy from Poland

My contribution to OTTD is both coding and making graphics. I've made no tunnels under mines/shafts patch, fix for CmdMoveRailVehicle, I'm working on more disasters patch, which is a bigger feature.
Also I'm time-to-time fixing this-and-that on the OTTD Wiki.

I'm interested in astronomy and informatics, probably much more.
