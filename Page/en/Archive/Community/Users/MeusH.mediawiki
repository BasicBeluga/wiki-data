Hello, My nick is Meusz (English pron. Maush), 16 years old guy from Poland.

My contribution to OTTD is both coding and making graphics.

My primary coding objective is to finalize and bug devs to add to the trunk my first big patch, called "more disasters" - which basicly adds more disasters, fixes OTTD disasters which were containing bugs, enchances some disasters to make them more scary. Of course developers help me with some coding, which I appreciate.

I've been drawing graphics for the GRF-system - you can find somewhere the trolleys which were about to be added to the game.
I've also made monorail\maglev waypoins, which were sadly never added to the trunk.

For the new graphic system, I'm creating and rendering models of various things: ufos, submarines, oil wells and cottages.

I'm interested in astronomy and informatics, more later... soorry lol
