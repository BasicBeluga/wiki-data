=Mihamix - OpenTTD Developer=

== Who Am I ==
My internet-name is Miham Kerekes, I am one of those guys, who joined the project lately. My main task is to organize the translators and manage the translations, though [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Bjarni]] does this job on the tt-forums, I wrote a [http://translator.openttd.org/ WebTranslator], which is now widely used amongst translators, since Webtranslator became the official way of translating OpenTTD.

My other task is generating [http://nightly.openttd.org/ nightly builds] for Linux platform

=== Patches made ===
My only patch to OpenTTD (not counting translations which got committed under my account) is the hungarian townnames patch, which is quite successful amongst hungarian players (at least I think this because of that countless positive user feedbacks :-)
Translations usually get committed once a day.
