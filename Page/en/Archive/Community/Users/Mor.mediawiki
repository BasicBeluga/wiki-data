|-
|  Enter <nowiki>{{</nowiki>'''cleanup'''<nowiki>}}</nowiki> inside an article if you think the article is not well structured, contains outdated information and is generally hard to read. Example:  <pre>{{cleanup}}</pre>
|{{en/Cleanup}}
|-
|Enter <nowiki>{{</nowiki>'''current'''<nowiki>}}</nowiki> inside an article if it contains information that is likely to change on account of being about a current event. Example:
<pre>{{current}}</pre>
|{{en/Current}}
|- 
|<noinclude>
*First clearly explain on the Discussion page what in particular needs expanding so there's a starter if people have questions. 
*Then enter ''<nowiki>{{</nowiki>expand|notes<nowiki>}}</nowiki>'' inside  the article or section that needs expansion, with a brief summary. 
*The summary needn't be too in depth - it's for the reader, the discussion page is for the editor. 
*The summary should be a sentence or phrase that makes sense in when it appears just after "This article or section needs expanding." in the message.
Example:
<pre>{{en/Expand|Needs complete list of bridges}}</pre>
This will add the article to [[:Category:en/Articles to be expanded]].
</noinclude>
|{{en/Expand|Needs complete list of bridges}}
