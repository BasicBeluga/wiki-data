We're using the "Temperate Basic" economy. Here's [http://bundles.openttdcoop.org/firs/releases/LATEST/docs/html/get_started.html#firs-gameplay an explanation of FIRS] and here's [http://bundles.openttdcoop.org/firs/releases/LATEST/docs/html/temperate_basic.dot.svg a flowchart for this economy]

[http://www.novapolis.net/downloads Simple City Builder's] menu doesn't correspond correctly to FIRS 2. However, this is our current setup:

* 100 Passengers from 500 pop Decay 50%

* 25 Mail from 1000 pop Decay 50%

* 100 Food from 2500 pop Decay 50%

* 50 Goods from 5000 pop Decay 50%

* 10 Alcohol from 10000 pop Decay 50%
