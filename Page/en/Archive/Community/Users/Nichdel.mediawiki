==Challenging Casual Server Setup==

I manage a small unpatched server where we try to keep things challenging yet fun. It was difficult for me to find configs and explanations, so I'm posting mine here.

===CargoDist===

===FIRS 2 Simple City Builder===

We're using the "Temperate Basic" economy. Here's [http://bundles.openttdcoop.org/firs/releases/LATEST/docs/html/get_started.html#firs-gameplay an explanation of FIRS] and here's [http://bundles.openttdcoop.org/firs/releases/LATEST/docs/html/temperate_basic.dot.svg a flowchart for this economy]

[http://www.novapolis.net/downloads Simple City Builder's] menu doesn't correspond correctly to FIRS 2. However, this is our current setup:

* 100 Passengers from 500 pop Decay 50%

* 25 Mail from 1000 pop Decay 50%

* 100 Food from 2500 pop Decay 50%

* 50 Goods from 5000 pop Decay 50%

* 10 Alcohol from 10000 pop Decay 50%

===Infrastructure Maintenance & Inflation===

Inflation is off to make the game easier to join at any point, and to make longer games more viable.

Infrastructure maintenance is on but at 1/4th (through Base Costs newGRF) default, to make the game more challenging but not too difficult.

===Vehicles===

[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Realistic acceleration]] is on.

====Trains====

[https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=50423 OpenGFX+ Trains], which are [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/Train Comparison|basically default]], with all but toyland active.

[https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=53743 Vacuum Tube Trains] for that post-2030 gameplay.

[https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=49287 SMITS] for a nicer looking maglev track.

[http://minchin.ca/openttd-progressive-rail/ Progressive rail] which makes it possible to run an engine on the next-level-up track, for easier upgrade. Even works with maglevs on vactracks.
