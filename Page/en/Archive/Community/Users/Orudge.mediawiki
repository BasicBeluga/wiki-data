My name is Owen Rudge, and I'm a TTD addict. I've written or worked on many programs to do with TTD, such as [http://www.owenrudge.net/TT/ttdalter TTDAlter], [http://www.owenrudge.net/TT/ttdxedit TTDX Editor] and the [http://www.owenrudge.net/TT/ttsgm Transport Tycoon Saved Game Manager], plus a number of web sites, such as [http://www.tt-forums.net/ The Transport Tycoon Forums], [http://misc.owenrudge.net/ttgame/ The Ultimate Transport Tycoon Game Repository] (new version soon to support OpenTTD games!) and [http://www.owenrudge.net/TT/ my own TT site]. I've also done some work on OpenTTD, having contributed the Bribe Local Authority patch, the multiple screenshot format patch, and other modifications here and there.

My latest work has involved a complete port to OS/2, and also a new music playing system, which, as of 4th January 2005, supports Ogg Vorbis, MP3, MIDI (via existing OpenTTD music drivers) WAV and also raw audio (the last one will likely be a development feature only ;)), and also supports reading custom playlists from an M3U file. Just need to fix a few bugs and I'll release it to the world! Well, to SourceForge at least...
