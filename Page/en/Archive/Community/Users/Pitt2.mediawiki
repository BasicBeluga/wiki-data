=Carrying Capacity Of Your Network=

So you've built a network, and you can gaze at it, get a feel for how much your junctions are jamming, but I've seen no attempt at a rigorous treatment of network capacity so far.

Rule 1 of good network design: trains on the network ''never'' slow down

Let's consider the various factors.


==Signal distance==

[[File:en/Manual/2-way signals.png|frame|right|Figure 1, Minimum train gap]]
This is a fairly obvious one. Widely-spaced signals will result in a lower carrying capacity. With a signal distance of one signal every N tiles, the '''Minimum Gap''' between two trains can never be less than N+1 (Figure 1). Note that, although the rear train has a green signal presented, were the distance between the two trains any shorter, then the next signal would still be red when the rear train reached it, as the forward train has not had time to clear that block, which would violate rule 1. When trains are this close together, you have reached the theoretical maximum train density. In practice, as we shall see, reaching this maximum density is nigh-on impossible. 


===So What signal distance should I use?===


In practical terms, one signal every two tiles gives a '''Minimum Gap''' of 3, and is the optimal practical solution. 

Whatever signal distance you choose, one important consideration is consistency. The capacity of a track is determined by whichever individual signal gap is the largest. Thus, a track with one signal every two tiles, that has an anomalous one-off gap of three or four tiles, will suffer from greatly diminished capacity and can potentially violate rule 1 (Figure 2)


==Train length==
This is a double-edged sword. A longer train will increase the likelihood of incurring a realistic acceleration penalty, which violates rule 1. However, a longer train length increases the '''Theoretical Maximum Cargo Capacity''' of your network. For example, figure 2 (right) has two trains of three tiles long, with the minimum gap between them. However, a nine tile train increases the cargo per track tile by 50%. The maneuverability sacrifice is usually not worth it, however, and 3 - 5 tile trains appears to be the norm.
