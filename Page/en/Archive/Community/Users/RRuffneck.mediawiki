Hi


I'm RRuffneck, as you probably would already have noticed :)

I'm from the Netherlands, 24 years old, and an old-school-tycoon (so i'm a newbie to OTTD ;)  )


Working on some wiki-pages (also as a Newbie):

I created '[[en/Manual/Refit|Refitting your cargo]]'.

I also placed these pages on Wiki:

the '[[en/Site support|Donate]]' page

the '[[en/Manual/Hotkeys|Shortcut keys]]' page


and edited some part about the [[en/Manual/Convert rail|convert rail button]] and other not mentioned pages.
