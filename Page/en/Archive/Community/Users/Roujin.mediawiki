= Introduction =

This is the user page of Roujin, player and patchwriter of OpenTTD.

I've played TTD(X) years ago (still have my original box displayed in my cupboard) and stumbled across OpenTTD in Spring 2007. I started playing and, eventually, making patches for this great game.


= Contributions =
Here are my contributions for (Open)TTD:

== Patches ==
'''In Trunk'''
* [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=34443 Area terraform] (allows raising/lowering an area of land) r11759
* [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=36190 Transparency lock] (allows locking transparency options so they won't get toggled) r12102
* [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=35661 Show supplied cargo] (adds a string in the station placement window to show which cargos are supplied at the selected position) r12596
'''Released'''
* [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=35613 Industry station names] (automatically gives stations built near industries the name of the industry)
* [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=35627 Advanced terraform] (CTRL toggles draw feature for raise, lower, level, dynamite, place stones, place rivers (latter two in scedit only))
* [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=36261 Traffic lights] (adds traffic lights to the game that road vehicles stop at when they have a red light. Towns can build traffic lights during road construction, if set up in patch option.)
* [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=36438 Random road construction] (road construction does not only happen when funded by a player, but also randomly, with a given chance. It can be configured in patch settings.)
* [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=36925 Menu jumping] (in the game menu, the view will jump to different locations for more variety, if used with an appropriate opntitle.dat - use signs to specify the locations to jump to)
* [http://bugs.openttd.org/task/1989 Random conditional order jump] (adds a new conditional order jump condition: a random chance of x%, where x can be set by the user)
* [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=691415#p691415 Forbid rocks terraforming] (forbids clearing/terraforming of rocks for more difficult gameplay. Scenario makers can then use rocks to create unchangable terrain)

== Graphics ==
I've drawn a [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=664352#p664352 toyland tree] for the [[en/Archive/Community/Graphics Replacement]] project, but that's nothing much compared to what others contribute to that project. Thumbs up guys, I appreciate what you're doing there!!

== Misc. ==
I've made some animated .gifs for TT-Forum, that can be used by anyone for example in his blog, or forum signature (of other forums) to advertise for TT-Forums and/or the TTD games.
See [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=572050#p572050 this post]. (That was also my first post in the forums)

== Patches bar ==
