I use my user page to maintain a list of features wishes. I will work on new feature concepts on these pages before posting them to http://bugs.openttd.org (Flyspray) or to the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=55 Forum].

Intended features need the implementation of their parent features.


* Orders GoTo button active: ctrl+click the station to set the order entry to "full load" {{en/Flyspray|1194}}
* Orders Window: GoTo button stays active (locomotion like behavior)
** On open the Orders Window: Goto button is activate

* [[en/GeneralVehicleList]] related: {{en/Flyspray|1324}}
** naming (and selection?) of shared orders (e.g. "Line 01"): these are actually group names
