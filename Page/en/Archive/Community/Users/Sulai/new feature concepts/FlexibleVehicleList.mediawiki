Rough idea: the new feature of grouping vehicles allows the user to do actions on a self defined list of vehicles. For example: "send all vehicles of this group to the depot" or "replace vehicles of this group". Vehicle groups are nothing else than lists of vehicles.

What about the windows "list all vehicles that visit this station" and "list all vehicles that share these orders"?

These are also lists of vehicles, and if we interpret these as groups, all actions available to groups are also available to these windows.

Lets see what this could look like.

Imagine playing OTTD. You want to have a look at all your trains. You press "list trains" buttons from the upper menu. In older versions of OTTD a window similar to this appears:

Nice. But note the little difference in the upper right corner. This will expand your vehicle list to the new-styled vehicle list with groups:
