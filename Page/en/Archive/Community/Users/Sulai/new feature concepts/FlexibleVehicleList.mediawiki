Rough idea: the new feature of grouping vehicles allows the user to do actions on a self defined list of vehicles. For example: "send all vehicles of this group to the depot" or "replace vehicles of this group". Vehicle groups are nothing else than lists of vehicles.

What about the windows "list all vehicles that visit this station" and "list all vehicles that share these orders"?

These are also lists of vehicles, and if we interpret these as groups, all actions available to groups are also available to these windows.

Lets see what this could look like.

=== Detailed Feature Concept ===

Imagine playing OTTD. You want to have a look at all your trains. You press "list trains" buttons from the upper menu. In older versions of OTTD a window similar to this appears:

Nice. But note the little difference in the upper right corner. This will expand your vehicle list to the new-styled vehicle list with groups:

This window works like the window we know from ottd060. But again, note the little difference in the upper left corner of the window. It's a drop down menu with currently selected "Groups". Lets click on that.

You can choose two more entries:
* '''same station''', which allows you to get groups of vehicles that use the same station
* '''shared orders''', which allows you to get groups of vehicles that have the same orders

With these groups available you can do further action.

This integrates nice into the existing game play. Have a look at this:

# open the station window
# click the litte "show all trains to this station" button. At this point we get the vehicle list as expected.
# click the "extend window" button. Now we see whats really behind the window: just a group of the type "same station".

*shared orders
*same station

more possible super groups:

stuff the sorting thing does too (no need if there was a multi-lines selection thing)
