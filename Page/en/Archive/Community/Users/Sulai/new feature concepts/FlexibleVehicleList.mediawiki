So there are groups now where you can put your vehicles in.

What about computer-generated groups that contain vehicles that match the same properties, like
* use the same station
* are in the same shared orders *group*
* did negative profit / less than 20k profit / more than 20k profit last year (red, yellow, green dot)
* same model
* same network

Groups are powerful because you can happily apply "mass commands" like "send to depot" or "replace" on all vehicles in a group.

Lets see what this could look like.

= Idea 1: two more simple categories: "same station" and "shared ordes" =

== Detailed Feature Concept ==

Imagine playing OTTD. You want to have a look at all your trains. You press "list trains" buttons from the upper menu. In older versions of OTTD a window similar to this appears:

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL without groups.png]]

Nice. But note the little difference in the upper right corner. This will expand your vehicle list to the new-styled vehicle list with groups:

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL with groups.png]]

This window works like the window we know from ottd060. But again, note the little difference in the upper left corner of the window. It's a drop down menu with currently selected "Groups". Lets click on that.

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL with groups and dropdown clicked.png]]

You can choose two more entries, lets name them "categories" as they are different from groups:
* '''same station''', which allows you to get groups of vehicles that ''use the same station''
* '''shared orders''', which allows you to get groups of vehicles that ''have the same orders''

These categories contain computer generated groups that contain the corresponding vehicles.

With these groups available you can do further action. 

Now this slightly modified vehicle list window can replace all other vehicle lists of the game. Which are - as far as I know - these two:

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL - same station.png]]

# open the station window
# click the little "show all trains to this station" button. At this point we get the vehicle list as expected.
# click the "extend window" button. Now we see whats really behind the window: just a group of the type "same station".

Note1: you can apply all commands under "manage list" to the vehicles shown. This is much more consistent compared to what we have now.

Note2: create/delete/rename group is grayed out as this makes no sense to vehicles groups in the "same station" category.

Note3: drag&drop should not be allowed

The same thing for the "shared orders":

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL - shared orders.png]]

# open the orders menu of a vehicle
# click the little "show all trains that share these orders" button. Again this window looks familiar.
# click on the expand button. Again you see it's just a group.

Note1:  Deleting a "shared orders" group means: every vehicle in the group gets a unshared copy of the orders.

Note2: Also creating new (empty) shared orders and giving them a appropriate name makes sense.

Note3: you can easily drag and drop the vehicles to put them into shared orders groups. (also if these are on other railway networks... =()

== protect from global auto replace ==

Needs a slight different behavior: it (un-)flags the single trains in the group. This means there are groups where some trains are protected and some are not.

== more possible categories or groups ==
To have the powerful group commands at hand for a variety of vehicle groups, it makes sense to have groups for many vehicle properties:

:*age newer than 2 years, out dated -- ungrouped gives all others
:*profit this / last year (red, yellow, green)
:*reliability
:*max speed
:*model
:*value

Note: these additional groups are obsolete, if there was a way to select multiple list entries and do drag and drop in the vehicle list. Then a simple "sorting - marking - drag to group" would do the same thing.

= Idea 2: global vehicles list and nested groups =

This idea includes the simple idea 1 but makes the group principle much more general (and much more powerful).

Imagine you have nested groups
Imagine there are auto-generated groups tagged as "network".
Imagine to have a "sell" button to network-groups, which happens to be a request button at the opponents vehicle list.

What could such a general vehicle list look like?

= conclusion =

The better the group handling, the better and more convenient you can mange a huge amount of vehicles.
