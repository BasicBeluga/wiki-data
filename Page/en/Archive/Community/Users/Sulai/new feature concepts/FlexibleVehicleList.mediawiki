This Feature is about vehicle groups and vehicles lists and how to combine these two things to one. Groups are powerful because you can apply "mass commands" like "send to depot" or "replace" on all vehicles in a group. So why not handle all types of vehicles lists as groups?

Lets see what this could look like.

== Detailed Feature Concept ==

Imagine playing OTTD. You want to have a look at all your trains. You press "list trains" buttons from the upper menu. In older versions of OTTD a window similar to this appears:

Nice. But note the little difference in the upper right corner. This will expand your vehicle list to the new-styled vehicle list with groups:

This window works like the window we know from ottd060. But again, note the little difference in the upper left corner of the window. It's a drop down menu with currently selected "Groups". Lets click on that.

You can choose two more entries:
* '''same station''', which allows you to get groups of vehicles that ''use the same station''
* '''shared orders''', which allows you to get groups of vehicles that ''have the same orders''

With these groups available you can do further action.

This integrates nice into the existing game play. Have a look at this:

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL - same station.png]]

# open the station window
# click the little "show all trains to this station" button. At this point we get the vehicle list as expected.
# click the "extend window" button. Now we see whats really behind the window: just a group of the type "same station".

Note: you can apply all commands under "manage list" to the vehicles shown. This is much more consistent compared to what we have now.

The same thing for the "shared orders":

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL - shared orders.png]]

# open the orders menu of a vehicle
# click the little "show all trains that share these orders" button. Again this window looks familiar.
# click on the expand button. Again you see it's just a group.

Note: 

more possible super groups:

stuff the sorting thing does too (no need if there was a multi-lines selection thing)
