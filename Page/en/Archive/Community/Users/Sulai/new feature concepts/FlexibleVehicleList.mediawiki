This Feature is about vehicle groups and vehicles lists and how to combine these two things to one. Groups are powerful because you can apply "mass commands" like "send to depot" or "replace" on all vehicles in a group. So why not handle all types of vehicles lists as groups?

Lets see what this could look like.

== Detailed Feature Concept ==

Imagine playing OTTD. You want to have a look at all your trains. You press "list trains" buttons from the upper menu. In older versions of OTTD a window similar to this appears:

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL without groups.png]]

Nice. But note the little difference in the upper right corner. This will expand your vehicle list to the new-styled vehicle list with groups:

This window works like the window we know from ottd060. But again, note the little difference in the upper left corner of the window. It's a drop down menu with currently selected "Groups". Lets click on that.

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL with groups and dropdown clicked.png]]

You can choose two more entries:
* '''same station''', which allows you to get groups of vehicles that ''use the same station''
* '''shared orders''', which allows you to get groups of vehicles that ''have the same orders''

With these groups available you can do further action.

This integrates nice into the existing game play. Have a look at this:

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL - same station.png]]

# open the station window
# click the little "show all trains to this station" button. At this point we get the vehicle list as expected.
# click the "extend window" button. Now we see whats really behind the window: just a group of the type "same station".

Note1: you can apply all commands under "manage list" to the vehicles shown. This is much more consistent compared to what we have now.

Note2: create/delete/rename group is grayed out as this makes no sense to vehicles groups in the "same station" category.

Note3: drag&drop should not be allowed

The same thing for the "shared orders":

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Users/FVL - shared orders.png]]

# open the orders menu of a vehicle
# click the little "show all trains that share these orders" button. Again this window looks familiar.
# click on the expand button. Again you see it's just a group.

Note1:  Deleting a "shared orders" group means: every vehicle in the group gets a unshared copy of the orders.

Note2: Also creating new (empty) shared orders and giving them a appropriate name makes sense.

Note3: you can easily drag and drop the vehicles to put them into shared orders groups. (also if these are on other railway networks... =()

more possible groups:

stuff the sorting thing does too (no need if there was a multi-lines selection thing)
:*age newer than 2 years, out dated -- ungrouped gives all others
:*profit this / last year (red, yellow, green)
:*reliability
:*max speed
:*model
:*value

== protect from global auto replace ==

Needs a slight different behavior: it (un-)flags the single trains but there could be mixed trains in a list.
