Hi. I'm tb2571989, real name Tom. <br> <br>

I'm kinda new to this wiki thing, not done anything like this before. Anyhoo, I'm still getting used to the commands, templates and all this newfangeled stuff. If you see a mistake, correct it, and/or tell me so I know what it was. <br> <br>

I dont know why the wiki capatalises the 'T' in my username, it's quite annoying for me. 
I'm also a [[en/Manual/Heightmap]] artist, so if you want a heightmap, contact me using the links below.

You can contact me:
* via Personal Message at the TT-Forums [http://www.tt-forums.net/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=11166 here],
* via my Discussion Page here,  
* via Personal Message at The Codex Forums [http://www.thecodexseries.com/forum/index.php?showuser=405 here],
* or, as a last resort, via e-mail at tombull89@aol.com
