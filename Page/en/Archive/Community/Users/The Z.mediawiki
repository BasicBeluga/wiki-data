==About me==
I finally created an account here horray!

Have been playing TTD patch (a couple of years ago) and now OpenTTD.

I have contributed here before but not logged in.

You'll see me doing all sorts of grammatical/spelling changes, as well as adding useful and helpful information.

==Other places==
On Wikipedia I'm under the username ''The Z UKBG''.
