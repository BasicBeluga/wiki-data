==About me==
I finally created an account here horray!

I used to play TTD patch (a couple of years ago) and have since been playing OpenTTD. I also play on Locomotion from time to time.

I have contributed here before but not logged in.

You'll see me doing all sorts of grammatical/spelling changes, as well as adding useful and helpful information.

I'm also an English > Bulgarian translator for OpenTTD.
