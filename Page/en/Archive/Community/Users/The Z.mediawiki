==About me==
I finally created an account here horray!

I used to play TTD patch (a couple of years ago) and have since been playing OpenTTD. I also play on Locomotion from time to time.

I have contributed here before but not logged in.

You'll see me doing all sorts of grammatical/spelling changes, as well as adding useful and helpful information.

I'm also an English > Bulgarian translator for OpenTTD.

==Multiplayer==
I'm now also running multiplayer servers. They'll be listed as 'The Z - Public server game #'. There's no password and games are/should be autosaved every month. I have yet to report any issues. Games will last around 100 years, at which point they will be paused, the savegame archived and a new game started.

===Games in progress===
Public server game 1

===Settings===
The settings for these games are usually adjusted to be accessible to beginners.

===Feedback===
If you'd like to send feedback or suggest a gametype, scenario or even request a map be played (i.e. one you've created yourself), don't hesitate to message me or talk to me in game (I play as 'The Z' - 'The Z server' I will not be monitoring).

==Other places==
