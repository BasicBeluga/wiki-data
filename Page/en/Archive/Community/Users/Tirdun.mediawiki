Mainly just a big fan, I've created two scenarios for OpenTTD, both of which use distance between source industries (i.e. forest) and factory industries (i.e. factories/mills) to produce long run money makers. 


My scenarios attempt to have realism through:

>> Realistic terrain and terrain transition

>> Basic road systems (often inefficient) set up in advance

>> Logically placed resources.
