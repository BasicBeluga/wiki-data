Mainly just a big fan, I've created two scenarios for OpenTTD, both of which use distance between source industries (i.e. forest) and factory industries (i.e. factories/mills) to produce long run money makers. I'm also a bit odd in that I set up road systems in advance (they're not always the most efficient, however) since I think it adds a realistic touch to a map.
