== Who am I? ==

I still wonder that myself... ;) No, serious: I am Patric Stout, male, 21 years old, living in The Netherlands. I like to fuck around a bit with people, so be warned.



== What do I do at OpenTTD ==

Darkvater asked me kindly to add myself to the Developer page, so I guess I belong there ;)

I created the New AI, mostly apply patches if people ask me long enough, I fix bugs, sometimes it takes me 8 hours to fix one, but it is fun ;)

I like OpenTTD, I like the concept. I played TTD when it just arrived. I played it a lot on LAN-parties with some other people who loved the game. So as you can guess, I love OpenTTD too ;)

Do I have something more to say... oh yeah, I host the NS-server for OpenTTD, and the main website (only www.openttd.org), and the SVN-shit. Nothing fancy.
