== Wolf01's Wiki Page ==
Hi, I'm Daniele, formerly know as Wolf01, I'm an Italian TT player, I love to develop patches, draw sprites and play, but the best thing I'm really able to do is the third one :P.<br>
I like more OpenTTD than TTDPatch, not because one is better than the other but because the different feeling I have with both games.<br>
I mantain a site and a forum dedicated to the TT world (and other things, because I don't have only one love :D), it is in Italian language and you can find it here: [http://transporttycoon.game-host.org http://transporttycoon.game-host.org] or here [http://wolf01.game-host.org http://wolf01.game-host.org] (which is the same, but with the "old name", the new one I think it might have more visibility).
