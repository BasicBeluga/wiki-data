A [[en/Manual/Stations]] [[en/Manual/Catchment area]], especially around a [[en/Manual/Stations]], is much more complex than one might think. Let's discuss this in some detail. 

This page assumes these [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Stations|station settings]]:

* ''Deliver cargo to a station only when there is a demand'': ON
* ''Nonuniform stations'': ON
* ''Allow joining stations not directly adjacent'': ON
* ''Max station spread'': 20 (or greater)
* ''Allow more realistically sized catchment areas'': ON

A disjoint station can be built by Ctrl-clicking while building additional stations. A window will appear giving player the choice of combining the new station with an existing station or building a new [[en/Logical station]]. Another way to create a disjoint station is to build a chain of stations as one [[en/Contiguous station]], then [[en/Bulldoze]] one or more of the intermediate links. 

== Station radius promotion == 

For a single [[en/Physical station]], [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Modified catchment]] is the same as catchment area. This attribute of a station is inherent. If the ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Stations#|Allow more realistically sized catchment areas]]'' option is ON then the station radius of a single physical station depends on the type of the station.

: ''For a [[en/Combined station]], the radius of each of its component physical stations is '''promoted''' to the radius of the most extensive component.''

So, the lone road station shown, '''Altoona''', has a radius of 3. The lone rail station, '''Altoona West''', has a radius of 4. But if we demolish Altoona West and rebuild it as a rail station combined with Altoona, then the road station's radius is ''promoted'' to 4 as well. 

From here on, we will discuss the general vicinity of the town of Altoona, with this disjoint Altoona station, in which each physical station has a radius of 4.

Altoona is the example or demonstration region for this discussion. The town of Altoona is itself insignificant; industry is discussed. 

Altoona is serviced by 3 logical stations: '''Altoona''', '''Altoona North''', and '''Altoona East'''. Recall that Altoona West was demolished; the rail station shown here was rebuilt, combined with Altoona. 

This region is also home to 4 industries: 

* '''Sawmill''', which accepts ''wood'' and produces ''lumber''
* '''Brick''' Works, which accepts ''sand'' and produces ''bricks'' (building materials)
* '''Glass''' Works, which accepts ''lime'' (chemicals) and produces ''glass'' (manufacturing supplies)
* '''Sheep''' Farm, which accepts ''farm supplies'' and produces ''sheep'' (livestock)

Other inputs and outputs for these industries are simply disregarded. Although the sheep farm does not require any input to produce; the other industries will produce nothing unless supplied. No industry will put cargo to wait at a station unless vehicles come to take it away. Therefore, offscreen, there are other stations and industries that supply and demand cargos; these are not important here and will not be discussed. The sole purpose of Altoona North and Altoona East is to handle some of this cargo to stimulate production and acceptance; these stations have no effect on the '''catchment area of the disjoint station''', Altoona; which is the subject of this page.
