I'm a big fan of this game and want to help out with the project.  I'm going through the source code slowly, hopefully I'll be able to fix a bug or 3 soon.



'''About redirects'''

Hi! I know it'll make wiki a bit unmanagable with a lot of pages redirecting. I am just not quite sure how to find pages I am looking for. User searching for "Buying trains" is just as likely as searching for "Selling trains". But in 1 case this leaves him with a Search results page, which frankly is annoying.
Is there a way to make wiki search better for articles (besides editing main text)? Like tags for pages or something? -- H3llkn0wz 18:16, 25 May 2007 (CEST)
