A list of my contributions to the OpenTTD community can be found below:


== Tools ==
* [http://users.tt-forums.net/ottdau/ OpenTTD Auto Update] - A tool to keep multiple OpenTTD installations up to date on the win32 platform. It handles many different release types: "Last Nightly", "Last Stable", "Last Stable (including pre-stable)" (stable + release candidates + betas), "#openttdcoop Public Server", etc. I wrote it because I was to lazy to downloading the nightlies manually each time. Also, I was in the need for an interesting Delphi project.


== AIs ==
* [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=41462 CluelessPlus] - The first public user AI was "Clueless". CluelessPlus keeps some of the original ideas but has over time got several improvements.
* [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=41518 PAXLink] - The only AI I know that use feeder systems. (to varying degrees of success)
* [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=42393 TownCars] - Populates towns with cars that drive around and looks nice. Read more in the thread about how to use this AI together with car newGRFs. 
* [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=47525 SuperLib] is not an AI, but an AI library where I've started to move code that is common between CluelessPlus and PAXLink. The main goal is to reduce my own workload for maintenance of the same code at two places, but if someone finds it useful for their AIs it is a nice bonus. Please tell me if you find it useful.

Please read more in the linked threads about each AI if you are interested.


== Patches ==
All my patches that has been submitted to FlySpray can be found on this address: (copy the entire address and paste in your browser)

The main feature patches in trunk that I have made are:
* Widget Focus
* Move AIs up/down in the AI settings window
* [[en/Development/Script/Need To Know#break-on-log-message| Break (pause) on AI log message]] based on a match string.

However, the size of the work behind the Widget Focus patch is much larger than the move AIs up/down patch. The devs should also be thanked for the time they have spent on reviewing my work and providing feedback.
