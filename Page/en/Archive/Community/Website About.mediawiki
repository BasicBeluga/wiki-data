Features
OpenTTD is modelled after the original Transport Tycoon game by Chris Sawyer and enhances the game experience dramatically. Many features were inspired by TTDPatch while others are original.

Significant enhancements from the original game include for example:

    * bigger maps (up to 64 times in size)
    * an AI that is actually worthy of its name
    * stable multiplayer mode for up to 8 players on LAN or Internet
    * dedicated server mode and an in-game console for administration
    * new pathfinding algorithms that makes vehicles go where you want them to (usually)
    * autorail build tool, improved terraforming
    * crossing tunnels
    * canals, shiplifts
    * larger, non-uniform stations and the ability to join them together (of same width or length)
    * real checkpoints instead of dummy one-tile stations
    * mammoth and multi-headed trains
    * clone, autoreplace and autoupdate vehicles
    * possibility to build on slopes and coasts
    * "go to depot" orders, check orders and view order destinations
    * order sharing and copying
    * longer and higher bridges including 2 new ones
    * reworked airport system with 2 more airports (international and metropolitan)
    * presignals, semaphores
    * preliminary support for TTDPatch newgrf features
    * build many trees on one tile
    * bribe the town authority
    * lots and lots of patch- and configuration settings to tune the game to your liking. Also look at the wiki.
    * save games with zlib compression for smaller sizes which does not interrupt gameplay
    * big support for internationalisation. OpenTTD is already translated into more than 24 languages
    * dynamically created town-names in 18 languages 

Lots of effort has been put into giving OpenTTD a better usability. These include:

    * convert rail tool (to rail, monorail, and maglev)
    * build stations with drag&drop
    * support of drag&drop for almost all tools (demolition, road/rail building/removing, scenario editor...)
    * sorting of most lists based on various criteria (vehicle, station, town, industries, etc.)
    * mouse wheel can be used to scroll in menus and to zoom in/out.
    * autoscroll (to left/right) when the mouse is near the edge of the screen
    * build in paused mode
    * sell whole train by dragging it to the dynamite trashcan
    * cost estimation with the 'shift' key
    * patch options configuration window, change settings from within the game
    * "debtmax" faster loan management with CTRL key 

Graphical/interface features:

    * screenshots can be in BMP, PNG or PCX format (select in game options menu)
    * more currencies (including Euro introduction in 2002)
    * extra viewports to view more parts of the gamefield at the same time
    * window mode with double zoom (CTRL+D to toggle) (MS Windows only)
    * resolution and refresh rate selection for fullscreen mode
    * colourful newspaper after a certain date
    * colour coded vehicle profits
    * game speed increase (through fast forward button or by pressing the TAB key)
    * snappy and sticky windows that always stay on top and neatly align themselves to other windows
    * more hotkeys for even less mouse-clicking 

Posting a full list would be futile as it would mean updating this page almost daily, and even then some things might be forgotten. Play with the game to experience all the features yourself, or look further at wiki.openttd.org for a more thorough listing and explanation of the features and possibilities ingame.
