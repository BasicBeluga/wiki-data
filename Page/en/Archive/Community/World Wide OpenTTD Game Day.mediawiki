==Idea==
The main idea is to have ''as many clients as possible at any given time'' - of course this is again a limited number as with every multiplayer game. Currently looks like our max clients number is 55 :-)

We also want to see a somewhat 'talkative' community... mutual silence is not what we are looking for.
In fact chatting will be required to some extent, as you may have to communicate with a bunch of people for what you intend to build. If you only want to play to build ''your'' stuff, single player mode is your way to go. Teamwork is not always easy, it can be a challenge at times and we just want to encourage everyone to be patient and peaceful to ensure a ''fun game for everyone''. Iif you have any issues in-game, contact one of the admins in a PM.

You will require [http://nightly.openttd.org/wwottdgd/files our #wwottdgd binary]
and the [http://openttdcoop.ppcis.org/wiki/index.php/Grf #openttdcoop grfpack] to be able to join the game.

''Thanks to TrueLight for building the binaries.''

==About==
Ammler once talked to me (dihedral) on IRC about a game with ''more clients''... i cannot remember how we managed to turn it into ''World Wide OpenTTD Game Day'', all i know now is that we a a week away and that we have more support that i had actually ever expected.

And we already have had talks about this only being the ''first'' #wwottdgd game...

==Rules==
* Following rules are '''''in addition''''' to [[en/Community/Play Style/Multiplayer Rules|the standard multiplayer rules]]
* Respect The Admins Judgment, Please Don't Argue
  As it already can be a pain to manage 10 clients, we ask to to argue with the Admins
  esp. not if it does not even concern you. We are working hard to get this day to
  take place as smooth as possible, this may or may not involve kicks/bans
  and ask for you to trust our judgement. thanks ~dihedral
* Build with the Terrain
  You go around / over / tunnel / bridge or you dont go at all!
  we are going to add a grf to signifcantly increase terraforming costs, why?
  because we want to preserv the landscape, amongst other things.
* Consequences
  The admins will ''move'' a player to spectator he/she disregards the rules/objectives layed down.
  Verbally attacking admins and/or other players may result in kick/ban.
