==Rules==
* Respect The Admins Judgment, Please Don't Argue
  As it already can be a pain to manage 10 clients, we ask to to argue with the Admins
  esp. not if it does not even concern you. We are working hard to get this day to
  take place as smooth as possible, this may or may not involve kicks/bans
  and ask for you to trust our judgement. thanks ~dihedral
* Build with the Terrain
  You go around / over / tunnel or you dont go at all!
  we are going to add a grf to signifcantly increase terraforming costs, why?
  because we want to preserv the landscape, amongst other things.
* Do that
* Do NOT such
