==WWOTTDGD #2==
WWOTTDGD 1 was a great success, with a total of 1295 clients connecting during the game period. A WWOTTDGD #2 is planned, but no details apart from the name of the event are confirmed yet. Use this page to post your ideas, suggestions, comments, or critisisms from the last game that would help to make a even better game next time :)

==About==
Ammler once talked to me (dihedral) on IRC about a game with ''more clients''... i cannot remember how we managed to turn it into ''World Wide OpenTTD Game Day'', all i know now is that we a a week away and that we have more support that i had actually ever expected.

==Suggestions==
I'm sure there are alot of suggestions that people have in their heads to make WWOTTDGD #2 better. Talk about them here :) To make things more organised please keep suggestions relating to the category they fall in.

===GRF===
Suggestions about what GRF's should be used.
*I reckon that since the game will probaly last for a long time, we should try and find an effective GRF that has a very wide timeline of new inventions. Most GRF's these days have the best train invented before the year 2000, lasting only 50-60 game years. A GRF that pushes this spread into the hundreds would make for much more interesting gameplay. Another way to do this would be to slow down how fast each day takes, making the years last longer.

===Map=== 
Suggestions about the map.
* Personally I think that the "Real World" map we used last time was not that effective. The size of the areas each company controlled changed significantly, and I think that for the next game a more symetrical map should be used.

===Patches===
Suggest any custom patches/improvements on current patches.

===Other===
Any other suggestions fall in here.

==Meeting Dates==
