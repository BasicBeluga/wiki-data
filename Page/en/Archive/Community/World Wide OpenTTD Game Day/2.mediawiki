==Gamesettings==
This things are still in discussion, if you like to participate, please use World Wide OpenTTD Game Day/2 or join us on IRC: [irc://irc.oftc.net/#wwottdgd #WWOTTDGD] channel or [irc://irc.oftc.net/#openttdcoop.dev #openttdcoop.dev] channel .

LA was so kind to provide a map based on an idea by Mark. The scenario proposed is that 6 regional companies cater for their region with one secondary industry each (2x factories, 2x saw mill, 2x refinery). The central island is run by a global company.

To be decided what to do with the central island in detail:
# only hub on island?
# only transfer station on island?
## will all products be transferred via this station?
# hub and transfer station on island?
## will only be goods be transferred via this station?
### will goods be distributed by global company?
### will goods be distributed by regional companies?
# 8th company = PAX company?: two transfers from islands 1-3 to 4-6?

==Map==
Rumor has it that LA is working on a nice map. - [http://wiki.openttd.org/index.php?title=World_Wide_OpenTTD_Game_Day/map_progress Map progress]

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Map LA.png|thumb|A teaser somewhat confirming the rumor :)]]
[http://www.tt-forums.net/download/file.php?id=91825 Symbolic map]

[http://www.tt-forums.net/download/file.php?id=91885 Height map]

Scenario is quite complete. Only some eyecandy to add hopefully. The map itself will be published after the event.
