1 = needed, 2 = nice to have, 3 = would be included if available

to be decided:
* will join-as-spectator be needed?
* will no-tf (with rcon option yes/no on per-company basis) be needed?
* will no changes on company name, colour and manager name be needed?

==Teams==
 Playercounter: '''5'''

Note: There's no special company as every company can use the infrastructure of any other - unlike the last time! So "Global Warming Inc." is by no means special - only in the respect that its HQ is in the centre of the map.

===Global Warming inc.===

* AntB
* LordAzamath (might be in some others too.. )
* Thgergo
* Farden
* Progman
* planetmaker

===Trenningpool Factory Co.===

===Bondingtown Woodster===

===Frebourne Oil Prod.===

===Lardston Sawmills===

===Pinninghattan Food Transport===

===Chaborough-On-Oil===

===Register here if unsure===
 * sign in... and we will assign you to a company later on

==Gamesettings==
This things are still in discussion, if you like to participate, please use World Wide OpenTTD Game Day/2 or join us on IRC: [irc://irc.oftc.net/#wwottdgd #WWOTTDGD] channel or [irc://irc.oftc.net/#openttdcoop.dev #openttdcoop.dev] channel .

LA was so kind to provide a map based on an idea by Mark. The scenario proposed is that 6 regional companies cater for their region with one secondary industry each (2x factories, 2x saw mill, 2x refinery). The central island is run by a global company. Products can be hauled from anywhere to your factory/saw mill/refinery in co-operation with the owners of the other sectors.

We have decided that in central island there will be
# Hub and transfer station
# Only goods will be delivered to the central station
# Goods will be delivered by regional company to central station.
<!--
To be decided what to do with the central island in detail:
# only hub on island?
# only transfer station on island?
## will all products be transferred via this station?
# hub and transfer station on island?
## will only be goods be transferred via this station?
### will goods be distributed by global company?
### will goods be distributed by regional companies?
# 8th company = PAX company?: two transfers from islands 1-3 to 4-6?
-->

==Map==
Rumor has it that LA is working on a nice map. - [http://wiki.openttd.org/index.php?title=World_Wide_OpenTTD_Game_Day/map_progress Map progress]

[[File:en/Archive/Community/Map LA.png|thumb|A teaser somewhat confirming the rumor :)]]
[http://www.tt-forums.net/download/file.php?id=91825 Symbolic map]

[http://www.tt-forums.net/download/file.php?id=91885 Height map]

Scenario is quite complete. Only some eyecandy to add hopefully. The map itself will be published after the event.

===TODO===

* The drop industries in the regions should be more inside the regions, not so much close the central region
* Breakdowns should be off (#openttdcoop standard)
* "Build in pause" cheat/setting should be off
* 90deg turns should be disallowed (#openttdcoop standard)
* Only 7 Companies (6+1), not 8
* Maybe no land between regions
