1 = needed, 2 = nice to have, 3 = would be included if available

to be decided:
* everything

==Teams==
 Playercounter: '''0'''

Note: There's no special company as every company can use the infrastructure of any other - unlike the last time! So "Global Warming Inc." is by no means special - only in the respect that its HQ is in the centre of the map.

==Gamesettings==
This things are still in discussion, if you like to participate, please use World Wide OpenTTD Game Day/3 or join us on IRC: [irc://irc.oftc.net/#wwottdgd #WWOTTDGD] channel or [irc://irc.oftc.net/#openttdcoop.dev #openttdcoop.dev] channel .

==Map==
is to be decided

===TODO===

* actually start and take initiative. Most important: start with a patch pack...! It can be YOU!

==Additional Admin Features==
(Text from wwottdgd/2):
There are a range of features, which help especially the administration:
* clients are joined into the company they've been in last time.
* The usual multiplayer save patch settings with a graphical representation can be accessed via the (patch) settings dialogue. As admin put the rcon password into your openttd.cfg
* There is a range of additional rcon commands:
**
** allow_terraform = {bitmask per company: 1=enable, 0=disable; default: disable}. disallows terraforming completely on a per company basis
** allow_company_changes = {bitmask per company: 1=enable, 0=disable; default: disable}. disallows changes to the company and manager name as well as the company colour on a per company basis
** one_tile_terraform = {0|1}: restrics terraforming to two edges of a single tile, if enabled
** a range of rcon commands concerning the sharing patch. They're more easily available via GUI in the patch settings in a seperate section.
* move clients: open the client list, click on the client and choose move. A menue with available companies + spectator will show up. Click on your choice
* mute clients: open the client list, click on the client and choose mute. Choose mute all, mute team or mute private in order to shut up that client. It cannot talk unless unmuted. Don't use it on eachother, we could mute ourselfs mutually.

==Bundles==
* none so far
