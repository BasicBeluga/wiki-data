==Compiling and developing OpenTTD on MandrakeLinux 10.0 Official==
A quick guide to get started with OpenTTD development on Linux.


===1.) RPMs:===

Most packages that are required for development (like gcc) should already be installed on your box. You will require those RPMs additionally:
*libsdl1.2-devel-1.2.7-2mdk
*subversion-1.0.1-1mdk (+ dependencies)
*libsvn_ra_svn1_0-1.0.1-1mdk


===2.) Subversion:===

To obtain the source code from the subversion server type:

<code>$ svn co svn://svn.openttd.com/trunk openttd</code>

from command line to dump the code into the directory 'openttd'.

To update your working copy to the latest revision use:

<code>$ svn update</code>

Don't worry, your version will be merged with the latest version.

The command

<code>$ svn diff > mypatch.diff</code>

creates a patch file (aka diff file) which you can submit to the developers to share your improvements.

You can undo changes to a file with:

<code>$svn revert filename</code>

===3.) Required data files:===

Copy the following files from the WINDOWS version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe to openttd/trunk/data/
*sample.cat
*trg1r.grf
*trgcr.grf
*trghr.grf
*trgir.grf
*trgtr.grf

===4.) Compiling and running:===

Compile OpenTTD with:

<code>$ make</code>

and run it with:

<code>$ ./openttd</code>

===5.) Playing the soundtrack:===

If you want the original TTD music you need to copy the whole /gm/ directory from Windows. Additionally the TiMidity driver is required:

*TiMidity++-2.12.0-0.pre1.4mdk (+ dependencies)

To run OpenTTD with music support type

<code>$ ./openttd -m extmidi</code>
