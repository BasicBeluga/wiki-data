This article gets you started on compiling OpenTTD using Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Editions.

=Required software=
:* [http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/default.aspx Microsoft® Visual C++ 2008 Express Editions] ''(current: Final)''
:* [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=529f03be-1339-48c4-bd5a-8506e5acf571 Microsoft® DirectX SDK - August 2007 or earlier] ''(needed for DirectMusic, more later)''
:* [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ea4894b5-e98d-44f6-842d-e32147237638&DisplayLang=en Microsoft® DirectX SDK - November 2007 or later] ''(current: August 2008)''


:* [http://binaries.openttd.org/extra/openttd-useful/ Openttd-useful.zip]
:** openttd_useful.zip is a collection of files of varying age. For the latest zlib, libpng and FreeType files you can browse their websites below.
:** [http://www.zlib.net/ zlib]
:** [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23617&package_id=16183 GnuWin32 libpng]
:** [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/freetype.php GnuWin32 FreeType]
:** [http://icu-project.org/download/ ICU4C]

:...and of course the newest source from <code>svn://svn.openttd.org/trunk</code>. You need to have a SVN-client to download the source from the SVN server. Pick either of the following two. For SVN novices TortoiseSVN is highly recommended:

:* [http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91 Command line version] ''(Subversion 1.4.5 Win32 binaries)''
:* [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads GUI TortoiseSVN]

=Installing=

===Microsoft® Visual C++ 2008 Express Editions===
:If you just need to compile OpenTTD it's enough if you don't select any options (see the image below).

:[[File:en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Microsoft Visual Cpp 2008 Express Editions.png]]

===Microsoft® DirectX SDK===
:'''Install the version November 2007 or later'''
:From the components screen remove the documentation and sample source code you'll save a lot of space. They're pretty useless if you just need to compile OpenTTD (see the image below).

=Copying from OpenTTD needed includes and libraries=
===openttd_useful.zip===
:Now extract the [http://binaries.openttd.org/extra/openttd-useful/ Openttd-useful.zip] file and copy:
:* The contents of the <code>include</code> folder to <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include\</code>.
:* The contents of the <code>library</code> folder to <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\lib\</code>.

===Microsoft® DirectX SDK - August 2007===
: '''Information''': The DirectX SDK from November 2007 is the first one which supports Microsoft® Visual Studio 2008. But it's also the first version which doesn't support DirectMusic which is needed to compile OpenTTD. That is why we must copy the missing files from an older version, preferably the final one for DirectMusic: 'August 2007'.
:* Extract ('''no double-click, do not install''') <code>dxsdk_aug2007.exe</code> in an extra directory and you get a file called <code>dxsdk_aug2007.exe</code> (yes that's right, both files have the same name).
:* Extract the second <code>dxsdk_aug2007.exe</code> in an extra directory.
:* Now copy following 9 files from <code>.\dxsdk_aug2007\dxsdk_aug2007\Include\</code> to <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK (November 2007)\Include</code> ('''note''': Please update the paths as necessary):
:** dls1.h
:** dmdls.h
:** dmerror.h
:** dmksctrl.h
:** dmplugin.h
:** dmusbuff.h
:** dmusicc.h
:** dmusicf.h
:** dmusici.h

: '''Alternative''': If you are willing to compile without support for MIDI music you will not be needing the older DirectX SDK. To disable music, remove the WIN32_ENABLE_DIRECTMUSIC_SUPPORT preprocessor definition from the openttd project using the project properties dialog.

=Compiling=
:* Open <code>projects/openttd_vs90.sln</code>. This will open your IDE with the project loaded.
:* To compile a non-debug version, go to <code>Build -> Configuration Manager</code> and select <code>Release for OpenTTD</code>.
:* Add the DirectX headers subdirectory through the openttd project properties -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories
:* Add the DirectX SDK Lib subdirectory through the openttd project properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories
:* Copy the data folder from your normal OpenTDD installation directory, typically <code>C:/Program Files/OpenTDD</code>, and paste the folder into <code>objs/Win32/Debug</code>.
:* Press <code>F7</code>, or go to <code>Build -> Build Solution</code>.
