This article gets you started on compiling OpenTTD using Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Editions.

'''Under construction!'''

=Required software=
:* [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/de-de/express/future/bb421473.aspx Microsoft® Visual C++ 2008 Express Editions] ''(current: Beta 2)''
:* [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=74dd6e2d-89c6-4e1e-af00-fc7d70f15439&DisplayLang=en Microsoft® Platform SDK] ''(current: 7/30/2007 "for Windows Server® 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5")''
:* [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=529f03be-1339-48c4-bd5a-8506e5acf571&DisplayLang=en Microsoft® DirectX SDK - August 2007 or earlier] ''(needed for DirectMusic, more later)''
:* [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4b78a58a-e672-4b83-a28e-72b5e93bd60a&DisplayLang=en Microsoft® DirectX SDK - November 2007 or later] ''(current: November 2007)''
:* Only for Windows® XP: [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=10CC340B-F857-4A14-83F5-25634C3BF043&displaylang=en Microsoft® .NET Framework 3.0]


:* [http://www-d0.fnal.gov/d0dist/dist/packages/d0ve/devel/windows/AFXRES.H afxres.h]
:* [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103924&package_id=114307 Openttd-useful.zip]
:** openttd_useful.zip is a collection of files of varying age. For the latest zlib, libpng and FreeType files you can browse their websites below.
:** [http://www.zlib.net/ zlib]
:** [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23617&package_id=16183 GnuWin32 libpng]
:** [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/freetype.php GnuWin32 FreeType]


:...and of course the newest source from <code>svn://svn.openttd.org/trunk</code>. You have to have a SVN-client to download the source. Pick either of the following two. For SVN novices TortoiseSVN is highly recommended:

:* [http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91 Command line version] ''(Subversion 1.4.5 Win32 binaries)''
:* [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/download.html GUI TortoiseSVN]


:'''Note:''' This guide has been made on Windows Vista 32bit.

=Installing=
===Microsoft® .NET Framework 3.0===
:Only for Windows® XP: Simple install it.
:Windows® Vista® get it automatically with the Windows Update®. You should start it bevor continue.

===Microsoft® Visual C++ 2008 Express Editions===
:If you just need to compile OpenTTD it's enough if you select '''"Graphical IDE"''' (see the image below).

:[[File:en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Microsoft Visual Cpp 2008 Express Editions.png]]

===Microsoft® Platform SDK===
:If you just need to compile OpenTTD I recommend to install the same options way I did, so it won't use a lot of unnecessary space (see the image below).

:[[File:en/Microsoft Platform SDK.png]]

===Microsoft® DirectX SDK===
:'''Install the version November 2007 or later'''
:From the components screen remove the documentation and sample source code you'll save a lot of space. They're pretty useless if you just need to compile OpenTTD (see the image below).

=Copying from OpenTTD needed includes and libraries=
===openttd_useful.zip===
:Now extract the [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103924&package_id=114307 Openttd-useful.zip] file and copy:
:* The contents of the <code>include</code> folder and [http://www-d0.fnal.gov/d0dist/dist/packages/d0ve/devel/windows/AFXRES.H afxres.h] to <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include\</code>.
:* The contents of the <code>library</code> folder to <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\lib\</code>.

===Microsoft® DirectX SDK - August 2007===
: '''Information''': The DirectX SDK from November 2007 is the first one who supports Microsoft® Visual Studio 2008. But it's also the first version which doesn't support DirectMusic which is needed to compile OpenTTD. That is why we must copy the missing files from an older version, prefered the final one for DirectMusic: 'August 2007'.
:* Extract ('''no double-click, do not install''') <code>dxsdk_aug2007.exe</code> in an extra directory and you get a file called <code>dxsdk_aug2007.exe</code> (yes that's right, both files have the same name).
:* Extract the second <code>dxsdk_aug2007.exe</code> in an extra directory.
:* Now copy following 9 files from <code>.\dxsdk_aug2007\dxsdk_aug2007\Include\</code> to <code>C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK (November 2007)\Include</code> ('''note''': Please update the paths as necessary):
:** dls1.h
:** dmdls.h
:** dmerror.h
:** dmksctrl.h
:** dmplugin.h
:** dmusbuff.h
:** dmusicc.h
:** dmusicf.h
:** dmusici.h

=Setting up the VC++ Directories=
:Start the Microsoft® Visual C++ IDE and go to <code>Tools -> Options</code>, then to <code>Projects and Solutions -> VC++ Directories</code>. Add the following lines ('''note''': Please update the paths as necessary):

===Executable files===
:* C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\V6.1\Bin

:[[File:en/MSVC 9 config 1.png]]

===Include files===
:* C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK (November 2007)\Include
:* C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\V6.1\Include

:[[File:en/MSVC 9 config 2.png]]

===Libary files===
:* C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK (November 2007)\Lib\x86
:* C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\V6.1\Lib

:[[File:en/MSVC 9 config 3.png]]

=Compiling=
:* Open <code>projects/openttd_vs80.sln</code>. This will open your IDE with the project loaded.
:* You will ask to convert the old project file to the new version, do it. ''(This is as long as OpenTTD haven't an own project file for Visual C++ 2008)''
:* To compile a non-debug version, go to <code>Build -> Configuration Manager</code> and select <code>Release for OpenTTD</code>.
:* Press <code>F7</code>, or go to <code>Build -> Build Solution</code>.
:* You will get a warning: <code>LINK : warning LNK4224: /OPT:NOWIN98 is no longer supported;  ignored</code> ignore it, it will be fixed if OpenTTD have an own project file for Visual C++ 2008.
