The simplest way to compile for Windows on Linux is to install [http://winehq.org Wine] and use it to set up the Windows MinGW - follow the existing [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Compiling on Windows using MinGW]] guide. This is rather slow (about 1/3 native speed for make, much slower for configure), but guaranteed to work.

However, you must replace (or DLL-override in winecfg) the Wine-supplied msvcp60.dll with an official Windows one (6.0 version) or SVN will not run. You can find it at [http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcp60 dll-files.com], click on the "Alternative versions" menu entry and download the second one listed. 

If you're adventurous, you can try Linux-to-MinGW cross-compilers, but they won't work with the current trunk code (Ubuntu 12.10).
