[[Category:en/Development/Compiling OpenTTD]]
The simplest way to compile an OpenTTD executable for Windows on any operating system supported by [http://winehq.org Wine], such as Linux, is to use it to set up the Windows MinGW - follow the existing [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Compiling on Windows using MinGW]] guide. This is rather slow (about 1/3 native speed for make, much slower for configure), but guaranteed to work.

However, you must replace (or override in the Wine configuration tool) the Wine-supplied msvcp60.dll with an official Windows one (6.0 version) or SVN will not run. You can find it at [http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcp60 dll-files.com], click on the "Alternative versions" menu entry and download the second one listed. 

If you're adventurous, you can try a MinGW GCC cross-compiler, but you'll need to make it work on your own at this time.
