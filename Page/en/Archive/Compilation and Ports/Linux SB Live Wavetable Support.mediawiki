It is possible to get OpenTTD to play music using the wavetable feature of a SB Live card (aka Awe32/64 or Emu10k1).  This method does not use timidity and therefore does not hammer the CPU.

These instructions are written for Ubuntu Feisty (7.04), so adjust as necessary for your distribution.

===Requirements===

You will need the following:

;<tt>asfxload</tt>:Provided by the <tt>awesfx</tt> package.
;<tt>aplaymidi</tt>:Provided by the <tt>alsa-utils</tt> package.
;A Sound Font:These can be found on the CD that came with your soundcard, or somewhere on your Windows partition if you have one.  This example uses the file <tt>8mbgmsfx.sf2</tt>.

===Load the Soundfont onto the card===

Put the soundfont into <tt>/usr/share/sounds/sf2/</tt>, then run
<pre>asfxload 8mbgmsfx</pre>
to load the soundfont onto the sound card.

You can make this load automatically at bootup by adding the following to an appropriate file in <tt>/etc/modprobe.d/</tt> (e.g. <tt>/etc/modprobe.d/local</tt>)
<pre>
# Load soundfont when module is loaded.
install snd-emu10k1-synth /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install snd-emu10k1-synth $CMDLINE_OPTS ; \
        sleep 1 ; /usr/bin/asfxload 8mbgmsfx ;
</pre>

===Configure aplaymidi===

Run
<pre>aplaymidi -l</pre>
You should see output similar to this:
<pre>
 Port    Client name                      Port name
 14:0    Midi Through                     Midi Through Port-0
 16:0    SBLive 5.1 [SB0060]              EMU10K1 MPU-401 (UART)
 17:0    Emu10k1 WaveTable                Emu10k1 Port 0
 17:1    Emu10k1 WaveTable                Emu10k1 Port 1
 17:2    Emu10k1 WaveTable                Emu10k1 Port 2
 17:3    Emu10k1 WaveTable                Emu10k1 Port 3
</pre>

Note the port for Emu10k1 Port 0 (17:0 in this example)

Run the following substituting the port above.
<pre>export ALSA_OUTPUT_PORTS="17:0"</pre>

You should now be able to use aplaymidi to play one of the gm files from the gm directory.

===Configure OpenTTD===

Assuming that worked correctly, the last step is to edit <tt>~/.openttd/openttd.cfg</tt> to make OpenTTD use aplaymidi instead of timidity.

In the [music] section set the extmidi line to:
<pre>extmidi = /usr/bin/aplaymidi</pre>

You should now have midi sound working in OpenTTD without it eating up all your CPU time.

To automate setting the port, create a shell script somewhere (e.g. <tt>/usr/games/openttd.sh</tt>) with the following:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

APLAYMIDI='/usr/bin/aplaymidi'

if [ ! -x $APLAYMIDI ]; then
        echo "Error: Cannot execute $APLAYMIDI"
        exit 1
fi

export ALSA_OUTPUT_PORTS=`$APLAYMIDI -l | grep "Emu10k1 Port 0" | awk '{print $1}'`

exec /usr/games/openttd
</pre>
Now use this to launch OpenTTD.
