This document list various GS ideas. Some may end up being implemented while others may never become anything more than just ideas.

== Goal Window ==
- Add a company selector (like eg. detailed performance window or AI Debug window)
- Allow GS to mark goals as completed
- Add a column for goal progress

== Towns ==
- Allow town growth goals that connect to the completion of a specific GSGoal goal.
- Maybe allow town growth goals to take an optional inhabitants parameter that will only make the restriction activate when the town population reaches this number.

== Company League / Detailed performance window ==
- Allow GS to register items for the detailed performance window
- Allow GS to set the current score on these items
- OpenTTD computes the performance rating based on these items instead of the default items
