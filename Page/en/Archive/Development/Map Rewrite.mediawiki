This page will collect the various designs, drafts and other thoughts about the new multilayer map array.

==Status==
Some work has been done on converting trunk to the new design. During this converting, we found out that it was a lot more work than we had initially thought. Instead of just converting code, a lot of code needed cleanup too, significantly slowing down the conversion.
For this reason, we have for now abandoned the conversion, focusing on cleaning up the trunk code first. Once the trunk code is significantly cleaned up and converted to using wrapper functions for map access, we might have another go at converting.
