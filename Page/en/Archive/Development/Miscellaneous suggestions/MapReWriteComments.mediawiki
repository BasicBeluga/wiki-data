For the multiple roadstop patch (MRP) it'd be helpful if we could store stop-based data in the map.

For this I suggest a struct:

typedef struct stop_t {
        //blathijs and I will think about how to optimize this: but a likely layout looks like this:
        uint8 status;    //whatever is currently in bus_stop_status and truck_stop_status
        uint8 slotA:4;   //a number > 0 indicates that the slots has been reserved. 
        uint8 slotB:4;   //the number itself contains the Time To live of the slot
} stop_t;

This struct should then be included in the station_t struct.
