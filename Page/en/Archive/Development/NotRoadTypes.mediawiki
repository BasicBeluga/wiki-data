== Road- and Tramtypes ==

=== Introduction ===

Road and tram are constructed independently.
You can build road with a certain roadtype on a tile, and you can build tram with a certain tramtype on a tile.
In general there are no implications between the two infrastructures, just like there are no implications to
railtypes on levelcrossings, though rail-, road- and tramtypes can forbid levelcrossings.

Each tile may have one roadtype and one tramtype.

=== Roadtype and Tramtype labels ===

Roadtypes and tramtypes are identified via 4-character labels between NewGRFs.
Labels of the different entities are independent.
You can have roadtype "OTTD", tramtype "OTTD", railtype "OTTD", cargotype "OTTD", ... independently of each other, in the same game or in the same NewGRF.

By default OpenTTD knows these labels, and provides graphics for them:

{| border="1" |-
! Label !! Roadtype
|-
|ROAD || Normal road
|-
|ELRD || Electrified road
|}
{| border="1" |-
! Label !! Tramtype
|-
| RAIL || Tramway
|-
| ELRL || Electrified tramway
|}
Tramtypes use labels very close to railtype labels.

Note, that catenary is not specific to tramtypes. Trolley busses are not trams.

=== Compatibility/Poweredness ===

This works the same as for railtypes.
Vehicles have a specific road-/tramtype label.

The road-/tramtypes specify, which other tracktypes their vehicles can drive on.

Both road and tram may have catenary, but the catenaries exist independent of each other.
A tile can show catenary, but still have "electrified road" and "not-electrified tram".


==== Example 1 ====
4 roadtypes:
* ROAD: Normal road
* ELRD: Electrified road
* OFFR: Off-road / dirt-road
* HAUL: Heavy hauling road

Compatibility:
{| border="1" |-
! Roadtype/vehicletype !! Powered roadtypes
|-
| ROAD || ROAD, ELRD
|-
| ELRD || ELRD
|-
| OFFR || OFFR, ROAD, ELRD, HAUL
|-
| HAUL || HAUL
|}

Note: Technically the specs do not enforce any "transitivity" for the compatibility.
That means, if A can drive on B and B can drive on C, A does not necessarily drive on C.

(the image does not include the transitive relations)

==== Example 2 ====
5 tramtypes:
* RAIL: Normal rail
* ELRL: Rail with catenary
* 3RDR: Rail with 3rd rail
* 3RDC: Rail with both catenary and 3rd rail
* 3ORC: Vehicles which can switch between catenary or 3rd rail power supply.
The last type "3ORC" is technically no build-able tracktype, just a vehicle type. (This is currently not implemented)
There are no vehicles which require both 3rd rail and catenary.

! Tramtype/vehicletype !! Powered tramtypes

| RAIL || RAIL, ELRL, 3RDR, 3RDC, 3ORC
|-

|-
| 3ORC || ELRL, 3RDR, 3RDC
|}

== Sprite layers ==

When drawing road/tram tiles, multiple sprites are drawn in layers over each other.

General rules:
* Pavement and roadsides (lamps, trees) are not part of any road- or tramtype. They are provided by the baseset only.
* There is only one underlay, either from road or from tram. Road takes precedence.
* Overlays are always drawn. (this is different to railtypes)
* There is only one catenary, either from road of from tram. Road takes precedence.

=== Global stuff ===

''Road-/Tramtype translation table:''
; NFO: Action 0 Feature 8 Properties 0x16 (roadtypes) and 0x17 (tramtypes) work the same as 0x12 for railtypes
; NML: "roadtypetable" and "tramtypetable" work the same as "railtypetable"

''Testing for road-/tramtypes:''
; NFO: Action 7 tests 0x0F (roadtype not defined), 0x10 (roadtype defined), 0x11 (tramtype not defined), 0x12 (tramtype defined) work the same as 0x0D and 0x0E for railtypes.
; NML: "roadtype_available" and "tramtype_available" work the same as "railtype_available"

=== Vehicle stuff ===

==== Properties ====

''Road-/tramtype of vehicle:''
; NFO: Property 0x05 (byte) specifies the entry from the road-/tramtype translation table.
; NML: "road_type", "tram_type" specifies the entry from the road-/tramtype translation table. ROADVEH_FLAG_TRAM must be set/cleared nevertheless.
If the property is not set, then road vehicles default to "ROAD" and trams default to "ELRL".

==== Variables ====

''Current road-/tramtype under vehicle:''
; NFO: Var 0x4A works the same as for trains. Bit 8 "is/would be powered" is always set.
; NML: "current_roadtype" and "current_tramtype" work the same as "current_railtype".

=== Road-/Tramtype ===

''Feature:''
; NFO: 0x12 for roadtypes, 0x13 for tramtypes
; NML: FEAT_ROADTYPES, FEAT_TRAMTYPES
There is no "parent" scope.

There is a global limit of 15 roadtypes and 15 tramtypes, including the default types.

== ToDo list ==

* Shall depot sprites include the track overlay? Or should it be drawn separately?
** Current status: Overlay is drawn if default depot sprites are used. Otherwise the depot sprites are expected to contain tracks.
** Future: Flag to enable/disable this behaviour? Separate default depot sprites for ROAD, ELRD, RAIL and ELRL in BaseSet Action 5?
* Which roadtypes are build and used by towns?
** Current status: Towns only build ROAD. Houses grow along all road- and tramtypes.
** Future:
*** Flag to enable houses along some road- or tramtypes. Disabled for default tramtypes.
*** Flag to enable construction by towns. Which type do towns choose? The newest? What is the newest? How/when do they upgrade?
* Disallow construction for drive-in stops:
** Current status: Roadtypes have drive-in stops, tramtypes do not.
** Future: Flag to disable drive-in stops for roadtypes. Tramtypes remain always disabled.
* Roadsides / fences
** Current status: The default roadsides are always drawn.
** Future:
*** Flag to enable default pavement.
*** Flag to enable default roadsides (lamps, trees).
*** Optional sprites for rail-style "fences" (highway barriers, trees, ...)
* Independent movement for road vehicle and trams
** Current status: Road vehicles and trams occupy the same space and block eachother's movement.
** Future:
*** Flag to enable trams to move independent of present road vehicles. (for example: suspension railway)
**** Vehicles clip through each other.
**** Track sprites would need drawing like catenary.
**** Next step "regular tram under suspension rail" fails.
* Non-constructible rail-/road-/tramtypes to model vehicle compatibility/poweredness:
** Current status: Vehicles can only use defined tracktypes. Tracktypes are buildable, if a vehicle exists for them.
** Future:
*** Distinguish "track and vehicle type" and "vehicle-only type".
*** "Vehicle-only types" are used by vehicles and reference other types for compatibility, but are not buildable themself.
*** "Vehicle-only types" should not count towards the "maximum 15 types" limit.
*** "Vehicle-only types" are visible in dropdowns that filter vehicles, like in the autoreplace GUI.
*** See also [[#example-2 | Example 2]] above, and {{en/Flyspray|5006}}.
* Foundations
** Current status: Road, tram and rail use the regular foundation sprites.
** Future:
*** Optional sprites for railtypes, roadtypes and tramtypes. (precedence in this order)
