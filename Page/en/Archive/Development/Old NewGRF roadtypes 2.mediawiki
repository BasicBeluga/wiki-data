'''Action 3 Cargo Types'''

Roadtypes are currently unavailable in OpenTTD. As with railtypes, its action 3 will re-use the 'cargo'-type definition in order to assign the type of graphics defined by the associated set-ID:

|Icons and cursors

|4 road directions (in cases diagonal roads is implemented), autoroad, depot, tunnel and convert road . First all icons, then all cursors.
|-
|01
|Tunnel
|4
|1 sprite for each direction. Sprite is overlay for track in existing tunnel graphics. The original ground sprite is drawn, then the overlay, then possibly a road vehicle and the original tunnel head is drawn over the top. This keeps compatibility with different landscape types. Sprite order: SW, NW, NE, SE.
