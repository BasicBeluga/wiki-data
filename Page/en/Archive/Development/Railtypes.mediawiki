==Rail type labels==

These work in the same way as cargo labels.
The default rail type labels are:

* RAIL
* ELRL
* MONO
* MGLV

By default, with no translation table in place, RAIL, MONO and MGLV are used. ELRL is selected by specifying RAIL and a tractive type of 2 (electric).

This changes with a translation table, and the selected rail type is used directly. If the railtype is unavailable then the locomotive becomes unavailable.

The translation table is loaded by action 0, feature 8, property 11.

===Railtype fallbacks===
Testing of different rail types can be provided by use of action 7:

 Action 0: Install table consisting of RAIL 3RDR ELRL
 Action 7: Skip next line if 3RDR exists
 Action 0: Install table consisting of RAIL ELRL ELRL

This will cause rail vehicles of the second rail type to be 3RDR if that type exists, or ELRL if it doesn't, allowing some flexibility.
