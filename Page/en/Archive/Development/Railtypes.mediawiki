==Rail type labels==

These work in the same way as cargo labels.
The default rail type labels are:

* RAIL
* ELRL
* MONO
* MGLV

By default, with no translation table in place, RAIL, MONO and MGLV are used. ELRL is selected by specifying RAIL and a tractive type of 2 (electric).

This changes with a translation table, and the selected rail type is used directly. If the railtype is unavailable then the locomotive becomes unavailable.

The translation table is loaded by action 0, feature 8, property 11.
