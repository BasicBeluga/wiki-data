[[en/Archive/Development/WebTranslator3]] is a web interface for translating OpenTTD. It was released in mid 2009, superseding the old [[en/Archive/Development/WebTranslator2]] interface.
The website can be found at [http://translator.openttd.org/ http://translator.openttd.org/]

You need to log in to view the translatable strings. If you do not have an account yet, you can easily register.
If you already have an account for viewing and want to help translating, send an email to [mailto:translator@openttd.org translator@openttd.org] in which you state your user name and the language you would like to translate.


If you have more questions, please refer to the [http://translator.openttd.org/faq FAQ].
