Changes planned for 0.4 (draft by TrueLight)

== 0.3.5 ==

All development freezes till the new _map array is done. No commits will be done at all.

The first thing that is going to be done, is change the current code to a readable _map structure, without adding new things (just rewriting).

This is all what will be done in 0.3.5



== 0.4.0 ==

This roadmap categorizes items in three groups. "Must" items (Those marked with a *), "should" items (those not marked), and "nice to have" items (those marked with a -).

Status can be one of "Not Assigned", "Pending", "In Progress" or "Finished"
