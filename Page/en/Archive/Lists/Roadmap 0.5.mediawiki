Changes planned for 0.4 (draft by TrueLight)

== 0.3.5 (will be released soon!) ==

We're going to release 0.3.5 soon, but the new map array hasn't been finished, so it will be only in 0.4.0.

In 0.3.5 there will be:
* new network and new gui
* newgrf support (+ gui)
* dos graphics support
* cheat gui
* new operating systems
* new languages
* custom currency
* new waypoint graphics
* bugfixes



== 0.4.0 ==

This roadmap categorizes items in three groups. "Must" items (Those marked with a *), "should" items (those not marked), and "nice to have" items (those marked with a -).

Status can be one of "Not Assigned", "Pending", "In Progress" or "Finished"
