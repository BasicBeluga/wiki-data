==0.6.0==
What you have been expecting for years.

Yes, the new map array and the new graphics system will be ready in 0.6.0. Maybe you will find a new audio format in this release too. Cargo destinations will come in a patch format, because not everybody wants to play with that feature. And the economy starts to act as in real life: not only the production, but for example the transporting fare will be balanced!

==0.7.0==
The first stand-alone version

Maybe in a few years we'll have released the first stand-alone OpenTTD version. This means that we'll have put our own, completely new graphics, sound and music in the package.
