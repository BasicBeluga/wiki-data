The Roadmap contains plans for future releases of OpenTTD. For information on previous releases, see the [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/Main Page|release history]].

==0.5.0==
The next major release

It will come with many sweet, new features: [[en/Archive/Manual/Yet Another PBS Patch|path based signalling]], electrified railways, station statistics, a new map generator, more NewGRF support etc. Some of these features are already in [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]].

==0.6.0==
What you expected for years

Yes, the new map array and the new graphics system will be ready in 0.6.0. If it will be ready than maybe you can find a new audio format too in this release. Cargo destinations will come in a patch format, because not everybody want to play with that feature. And the economy start to be act as in real life: not only the production, but for example the transporting fare will be balancig!

==0.7.0==
The first stand-alone version

Maybe in a few years we'll have the first stand-alone OpenTTD version out. It means that we put our completely new graphics, sound (music+FX) in the package with the unicode translation system, including Russian and Chinese translations.
