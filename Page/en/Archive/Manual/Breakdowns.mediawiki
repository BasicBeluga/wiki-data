[[en/Manual/Vehicles]] '''Breakdowns''' occur when a vehicle is in transit. It usually cause a vehicle to stop for a while, causing traffic buildup, but planes will only get a speed reduction which lasts until until its speed drops below 6 mph/9 kmh.

The amount of breakdowns that occur to a vehicle is directly relevant to its reliability rating and age. The number can be reduced by regular [[en/Manual/Servicing]] to a vehicle via a depot or hangar. In the case of road vehicles, a breakdown can occur to trigger the Small UFO [[en/Manual/Disasters]], where a UFO will crash into a broken down road vehicle. Breakdowns can be turned on or off via the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Difficulty]].
