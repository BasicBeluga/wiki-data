[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Crossing tunnels]]
You know how anoying it was bwfore, building this huge rail and want it to tunel thru a mountain, then you klick it and you get this message "Can't tunnel thru here: There's a tunel in the way"

Now, OTTD has something against that... Though it's considered a cheat, why i'll explain later, click ctrl + alt + c and look for "Enable tunnel crossings"

Now, et voila, you can built the tunel!

Why it's a cheat? Now, the original creator of this, eis_os, the TTDPatch developer, tought that it was stupid that long tunels couln't pass thru eachother. So, he made this cheat.  Unfortunetely, he was unable to limit it to long tunels that could in reality have passed under or over eachother, so now, people could tunnel thru a 6x6 hillside from both sides.

I'll edit in images tomorrow...
