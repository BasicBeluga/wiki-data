[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Crossing tunnels]]
You know how annoying it was before, building this huge rail and want it to tunnel through a mountain, then you click where to tunnel "Can't tunnel through here: There's a tunnel in the way", just because you forgot that there already was a tunnel.

Now, OTTD has something to counter that... Though it's considered a cheat, why I'll explain later, click ctrl + alt + c and look for "Enable tunnel crossings"

Now, et voila, you can built the tunnel!

Why it's a cheat? Now, the original creator of this, eis_os, the TTDPatch developer, thought that it was stupid that long tunnels couldn't pass under or over each-other. So, he made this cheat.  Unfortunately, he was unable to limit it to long tunnels that could in reality have passed under or over each-other, so now, people could tunnel through a 6x6 hillside from both sides, making trains pass through each-other. Yet in OpenTTD, the distance still haven't been limited, so it's put in the cheat menu.

I'll edit in images tomorrow...
