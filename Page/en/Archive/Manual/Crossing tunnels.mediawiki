== Prologue ==

We all know how annoying it was when you'd be building a huge rail, and wanted to tunnel through a mountain; you'd click on the square where the entrance should be, and the only response is that annoying "Can't tunnel through here: another tunnel in the way" message, simply because you forgot there was already a tunnel through that mountain.


== Using the patch ==

Now, OTTD has the answer to that, although it is considered a cheat (I'll explain why later) -- press Control + Alt + C and look for "Enable tunnel crossings".


(Try to avoid the temptation of giving yourself a couple million; it'll ruin your game)

''Voila!'' you may now build the tunnel!

== Why is it a cheat? ==

The original creator of this patch, the [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]] developer eis_os, thought that it was stupid that long tunnels couldn't pass under or over each other, so he made this patch.  Unfortunately, he was unable to limit it to only long tunnels that could in reality have passed under or over each other, so now, people can tunnel through a 6x6 hillside from both sides, making trains pass through each-other. 

This behaviour has not changed in [[en/Manual/Main Page]]; thus, it is considered a cheat.
