[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Crossing tunnels]]
You know how anoying it was before, building this huge rail and want it to tunel through a mountain, then you klick where to tunnel "Can't tunnel thru here: There's a tunel in the way", just because you forgot that there already was a tunel.

Now, OTTD has something to counter that... Though it's considered a cheat, why i'll explain later, click ctrl + alt + c and look for "Enable tunnel crossings"

Now, et voila, you can built the tunel!

Why it's a cheat? Now, the original creator of this, eis_os, the TTDPatch developer, tought that it was stupid that long tunels couln't pass under or over eachother. So, he made this cheat.  Unfortunetely, he was unable to limit it to long tunels that could in reality have passed under or over eachother, so now, people could tunnel thru a 6x6 hillside from both sides, making trains pass throuch eachother. Yet in OpenTTD, the distance still havent been limited, so it's put in the cheat menu.

I'll edit in images tomorrow...
