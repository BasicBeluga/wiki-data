You can download the latest game files for your [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Operating system]] from [http://www.openttd.org/download-stable openttd.org], where you can choose between binaries, source or installer type of download.

In addition you will need game data files (e.g. graphics, sound effects). You can either use the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe data files or our free alternatives [[en/Archive/Community/OpenGFX Readme]] (graphics) and [[en/Archive/Community/Sound Effects Replacement]] (sound) which you can download at the same location as well.

For installation see the [[en/Archive/Manual/Installation FAQ|installation FAQ]] for details.
