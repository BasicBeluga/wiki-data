In OpenTTD, the '''headquarters'' or '''"HQ"''' is the building where all administration of your business is carried out. You can click on a headquarters to open the [[en/Manual/Transport company]], to change any details for your company. 

The headquarters, like your company, will grow larger and upward to show your success as a company. Overall there are five stages for the headquarters, starting off as a small building no larger than a house, and finishing as a very tall skyscraper sized building.

The HQ also accepts passengers and mail delivered to it as well as provides a limited amount of passengers and mail itself.

As the HQ shows your success, it is common for players to build them as centerpieces of the transport empire, usually atop a large, artificial mountain, or on an island in the sea. It is common to see millions spent on such large areas.

There are various different HQ [[en/Manual/NewGRF]]s available.
