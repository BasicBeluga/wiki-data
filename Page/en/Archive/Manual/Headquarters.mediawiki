[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Headquarters]]

In OpenTTD, the '''headquarters''' or '''HQ''' is the building where all administration of your business is carried out. You can click on a headquarters to open the [[en/Manual/Transport company]], to change any details for your company. It is not necessary to build.

The headquarters, like your company, will grow larger and upward to show your success as a company (growing bigger as company earns more [[en/Manual/Detailed Performance Rating|Performance Rating points]]). Overall, there are five different stages for the headquarters, starting off as a small building no larger than a house, and finishing as a very tall skyscraper-sized building.

The headquarters also accepts any [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Passengers]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Mail]] in its later stages that are delivered to it, as well as providing a limited amount of passengers and mail itself. During an [[en/Manual/Economy#recession|economic recession]] there is only half of the usual amount of passengers and mail.

HQ  #1 accepts nothing.

HQ  #2 and #3 accepts passengers.

HQ  #4 and #5 accepts passengers and mail.

As the HQ shows your success, it is common for players to build them as centerpieces of the transport empire, usually atop a large, artificial mountain, or on an island in the sea. It is not uncommon to see millions spent on such large areas.

There are various different [[en/Manual/NewGRF]]s available if you don't like your HQ design, or it seemingly dwarfed by other buildings in a town.
