[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Higher bridges]]
This [[en/Community/Patches/Patches|patch]] enables you to build bridges not just at sea-level but higher.

== Description ==

Normally, bridges can only be built at one-level above the ground they are spanning.  With this patch, it is possible to place bridges which span deeper gaps, as the picture shows.

== Use ==

This patch is disabled by default.  When enabled, building a bridge as normal but over a high gap will allow you to build the bridge and show it's extended struts which will reach to the floor.
