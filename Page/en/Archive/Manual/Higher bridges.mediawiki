[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Higher bridges]]
This [[en/Community/Patches/Patches|patch]] enables you to build bridges not just at sea-level but higher.

== Description ==
Normally, bridges can only be built at one-level above the ground they are spanning.  With this patch, it is possible to place bridges which span deeper gaps, as the picture shows.

[[File:en/Archive/Manual/Higher bridges.png|Fig 1.0 - Higher Bridges, in action.]]

== Use ==
This patch is enabled by default.  When enabled, building a bridge as normal but over a high gap will allow you to build the bridge and show it's extended struts which will reach to the floor. You can NOT? /FIXME PLEASE/ enable this patch through the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Construction|configure patches -> construction]] /FIX THE LINK - THIS PATCH PROBABLY DOESN'T EXIST IN CONFIGURE PATCHES WINDOW/ window or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:

<pre>
[patches]
bridge_pillars = false
</pre> /IS IT REALLY THIS?/

Note: I couldn't find it anywhere in the patch settings. Code says syntax above is just for drawing pillar images. If this patch no longer exists for user to change, .cfg file should be changed and this page may be deleted.
