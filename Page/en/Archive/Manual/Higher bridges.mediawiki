[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Higher bridges]]
This [[en/Community/Patches/Patches|patch]] enables you to build bridges not just at sea-level but higher.

{{en/Warning|This page is out of date and contains faulty information.  Please see the Higher bridges page for details.}}

== Description ==
Normally, bridges can only be built at one-level above the ground they are spanning.  With this patch, it is possible to place bridges which span deeper gaps, as the picture shows.

[[File:en/Archive/Manual/Higher bridges.png|Fig 1.0 - Higher Bridges, in action.]]

== Use ==
This patch is enabled by default.  When enabled, building a bridge as normal but over a high gap will allow you to build the bridge and show its extended struts which will reach to the floor. You can enable this patch through the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Construction|configure patches -> construction]] window or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:

<pre>
[patches]
bridge_pillars = false
