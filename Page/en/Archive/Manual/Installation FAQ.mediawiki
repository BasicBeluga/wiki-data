:There are, of course, other (longer) ways to perform this installation, this is just the easiest/quickest route. ''(but if you took the longer route... would it increase the route income?.. or should you wait for monorail... ..)''

: *You can also use the files from the DOS version of TTD by copying the files in the data/ directory into your OpenTTD data/ directory

=====Linux?=====
* As with most things in Linux, there are various ways to get a working copy of OpenTTD:
:* You may find OpenTTD in your distro's packaging system, e.g. Aptitude, Yum, Portage and YaST. For info about using such a system, check your distro's manual or website.
:* You can find packages for some distros on the sourceforge project page, such as .deb and .rpm files.
:* You can download the source and compile the game yourself! You can read how to do this here: [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Compiling on GNUâˆ•Linux and ðŸŸ‰BSD]]
* Now that you should have a copy of OpenTTD, you will need some of the Transport Tycoon Deluxe data files which contain images and sounds:
:* If you used a package to install the game:
::* You can insert your TTD CD-ROM and copy the needed files to your /usr/share/games/openttd/data directory. (The needed files are listed below)
::* If you have a multiboot system which includes a windows partition or if you have access to a windows system over your network which has TTD installed, you can copy the needed files from the installation directory to /usr/share/games/openttd/data. (The needed files are listed below)
:::*If you copy the files from another PC on the network, be sure that you are in the posession of a license to the files!
:* If you compiled the game yourself:
::* You can insert your TTD CD-ROM and copy the needed files to the ./data directory in the directory where you compiled the game. (The needed files are listed below)
::* If you have a multiboot system which includes a windows partition or if you have access to a windows system over your network which has TTD installed, you can copy the needed files from the installation directory to the ./data directory in the directory where you compiled the game.

:#Note down where you installed/unzipped the game.
:#Get the OSX installer for OpenTTD from the [http://www.openttd.com/downloads.php downloads page].
:#Mount the downloaded image and copy OpenTTD into a folder of your choice (it is recommended that it's empty as OpenTTD will add files to it).
:#Make a folder called "data" and move the grf files and sample.cat into it
:#Run OpenTTD.

====What files do I need from TTD?====
:*If you are not using the installer to install OpenTTD, (or are just curious) you need to copy certain files by hand.
:Required files; put these in the <i>data/</i> folder:
::* Graphic files: <b>trg1r.grf</b>, <b>trgcr.grf</b>, <b>trghr.grf</b>, <b>trgir.grf</b>, <b>trgtr.grf</b>
:::*If you are using the DOS version of TTD to copy the files from, you need the files which are named above but without the "R" on the end, e.g. trg1.grf etc.
::* Sound files: <b>sample.cat</b>
:If you also want music, ''(the all important cheesy midi goodness)'' copy the following files to the  <i>gm/</i> folder:
::* Music files: <b>*.gm</b>
