[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Installation FAQ]]


This FAQ covers questions about installing OpenTTD.

== What do I need to run OpenTTD? ==
You will need to be running one of the [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Operating system|supported operating systems]]. Then check that your system meets the [[en/Archive/Manual/System Requirements]].

== How do I install OpenTTD? ==
See [[en/Manual/Installation]].

== Can I use the original TTD files? ==

In short: No TTD files are needed, free base graphics, sounds and music do exist. But you can still use the base files from TTD:

:If you are not using the installer to install OpenTTD, (or are just curious) you need to copy certain files by hand.
:Required files; put these in the <i>baseset/</i> folder:
:* Graphic files: <b>trg1r.grf</b>, <b>trgcr.grf</b>, <b>trghr.grf</b>, <b>trgir.grf</b>, <b>trgtr.grf</b>
:If you are using the DOS version of TTD to copy the files from, you need the files which are named above but without the "R" on the end, e.g. trg1.grf etc.
:* Sound files: <b>sample.cat</b>
:* Music files: <b>*.gm</b>
:If there is no gm folder, just create it in the main openttd folder, and put the files there. Note that DOS version of TTD does not have <b>*.gm</b> files.

On *nix computers, you need make sure you have permission to view the above files as a normal user, otherwise, you will only be able to run OpenTTD as root.

== What about nightly builds? ==
The nightly builds can be used parallel to stable build. Download the latest nightly build archive, then extract it into a new folder without installation required. Just run the binary.

To always play the latest nightly you can use an [[en/Archive/Community/OpenTTD Updaters|updater]] to update to latest [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build]] when you start the OpenTTD.
