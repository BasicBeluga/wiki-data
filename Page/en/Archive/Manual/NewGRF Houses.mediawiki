[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/NewGRF Houses]]
Newhouses enables authors to add new building graphics to the existing set of town buildings, as well as alter most of the properties of these buildings.  This functionality provides many advantages, including:
*'''More diverse towns''' - town buildings will no longer be as repetitive, as OpenTTD will have a wider selection of buildings to choose from (the current limit of different buildings is 110 -- Newhouse will raise that limit to 512)
*'''Customizable climate settings''' - authors can specify which buildings occur in which climates.
*'''Changeable Cargo Acceptances''' - a building can now accept customizable numbers/types of cargo.  For example, one building could accept 7/8 Passengers and 3/8 Food, but no mail, while another could accept only 1/8 Passengers but 6/8 Goods and 5/8 Mail
*'''Appearance Probabilities''' - The probability of each individual building being generated by a town can be adjusted, such that an ultra-special "secret" building could be appear that generates full Passengers, Goods, Mail itself, but is very rare and therefore likely to appear only once on an entire map.  Or perhaps a "landmark" building appears, such as the Eiffel Tower, but is rare enough that 40 of them don't appear in the same town. :-)  Alternatively, perhaps very common buildings, such as gas stations, have a higher probability assigned to them, so they appear more often, as they do in real life. (''Please note that these are just conceptual examples - the presence or absence of these examples are entirely up to the community of authors'')
*'''Building Timeframes''' - Authors will be able to set which years a given building could appear, allowing for a time-appropriate look to the game.
*'''Customized sounds''' - Each building could have customized sounds for various events (construction, demolition, etc.)
*'''Full support for TTDPatch NewGRFs''' - OpenTTD with Newhouses should enable all new buildings that have been created specifically for TTDPatch users to work within OpenTTD as well.


Note that ''replacement'' building graphics are supported as of version 0.5.0 of the game.  However, this differs from Newhouses in a couple of key ways:
#Any new building images simply REPLACE existing graphics, rather than adding to the overall pool of potential building images.  In other words, right now, to put a new image in, you have to sacrifice one that already exists
#There is no current support for altering a building's properties.  Only its image can change.
