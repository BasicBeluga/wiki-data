==Input Dialogs==

Specifically, this is the Company Name input dialog, but they all work the same. The upper left X closes the dialog without saving. This is the same effect as the Cancel button. The OK button saves the value that has been typed in. To the right of the X is the dialog name, or more specifically, what piece of informatuon your are either inputting or editing. To edit the text/input into the dialog, simply click black text bar, and your keyboard will work there. Pressing return from this edit mode has the same effect as clicking OK. An input dialog can also be dragged around the environment to different positions, by left clicking and holding on the name bar and moving the mouse around. Also, under the Windows operating system, ctrl-v will paste the clipboards current text into the dialog, presuming you are currently editing its text.
