==Introduction==
Path Based Signalling (or PBS for short) is a new feature in OpenTTD that allows you to have more than one train in a signal block. A screenshot of this in action can be seen below, where three trains are sharing a signal block.

==Using PBS==
All you need to achieve this is turn on [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/New global pathfinding|New Pathfinding]], and then build PBS signals at the junctions.If you have a look at this screenshot of the same place slightly later, you have to build special signals to use PBS.

To create this signals, just place normal signals, then press Ctrl and click on them four times, as if placing pre-signals.

==Autoplacement of Signals==
To prevent players from getting RSI a feature has been added so you only need to place an entrance and exit PBS signal, and the rest will be automatically converted to PBS signals. To do this, just place normal signals where you want your PBS signals to be, and convert an entrance and exit signal to PBS signals.

The animation below shows you how to do this.

One of the problems with autoplacement, is that wants you have the block done as a PBS one, you have to destroy it to remove the PBS features.
