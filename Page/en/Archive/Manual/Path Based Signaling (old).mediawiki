==Introduction==
Path Based Signalling (or PBS for short) is a new feature in OpenTTD that allows you to have more than one train in a signal block. A screenshot of this in action can be seen below, where three trains are sharing a signal block.

==Using PBS==
All you need to achieve this is turn on [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/New global pathfinding|New Pathfinding]], and then build PBS signals at the junctions.If you have a look at this screenshot of the same place slightly later, you have to build special signals to use PBS.

To create these signals, just place normal signals, then press Ctrl and click on them four times, as if placing pre-signals.

==Autoplacement of Signals==
To prevent players from getting [[en/RSI]], a feature has been added so you only need to place an entrance and exit PBS signal, and the rest will be automatically converted to PBS signals. To do this, just place normal signals where you want your PBS signals to be, and convert an entrance and exit signal to PBS signals.

The animation below shows you how to do this.

There is one problem with autoplacement. Once you have created the PBS block, you will have to destroy all the signals in order to remove the PBS feature.

==Viewing reserved path of trains==
The original patches for PBS showed the paths that trains had reserved, and a number of people liked this idea to help with debugging their junctions. The version that was merged into the game still has this option, but it is disabled by default. In order to use it please run the game with the PBS debug level set to 1 or greater. You can do this by passing "-d pbs=1" as a [[en/Manual/Command line|command line option]] or you can set it via the [[en/Manual/Console|console]] with "debug_level pbs=1" (to turn it off change the 1 to a 0).

==Other notes==
If you try and modify a live PBS junction it is quite likely that a crash will occur. As such you should stop all trains before they enter the junction if you need to modify it.

Path Based Signalling is not avaible in OpenTTD 0.4.0.1 (the latest release), so if you would like to play with this feature you should download one of the recent [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build|nightlies]].
