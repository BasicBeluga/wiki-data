To reset a company in a multiplayer game through the console you need to use the "reset_company" command. To find out the id of a company to clean, you can use the "players" command. See a detailed list of all [[en/Manual/Console Commands|console commands]]   available and their usage.<br /><br />
If you are playing as a client on your own dedicated server and want to use this command you might want to look into the [[en/Manual/Dedicated server|rcon command]].
