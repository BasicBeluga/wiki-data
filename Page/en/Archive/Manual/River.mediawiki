'''Rivers''' has been introduced in OpenTTD during the development towards [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/OpenTTD 0.6.0]] (more concret in r11926). The first testing-release which contained the feature was OpenTTD 0.6.0-beta 4. Rivers are similar to [[en/Manual/Water Transport Tiles]] but can be generated during the map generation-process(since r22767).

[[en/Manual/Ships]]s can sail via level river, but the river on a slope must be reconstructed to a [[en/Manual/Water Transport Tiles]] [[File:en/Manual/Build locks.png]] for passage. River will automatically connect to a Canal [[File:en/Manual/Build canal.png]] when the latter is constructed adjacent to it.

As of [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/OpenTTD 1.3.2]], player can only build river in [[en/Manual/Scenario editor]] (available to waterway construction menu) but not normal gameplay. It can be paid to [[en/Manual/Landscaping]] and return to normal land. The cost equals to demolish a sea-level water tile with the initial cost of 7,500 pounds per each tile. Unlike other landscape features such as rock or tree, demolishing river does '''not''' reduce [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#local-authority-rating|player's company rating]] to the nearby [[en/Manual/Local authority]]. [[en/Manual/Towns]] will not demolish river while extending, instead it will use [[en/Manual/Bridges]] to cross over the river.
