[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Scenario]]
A '''Scenario''' or '''Landscape''' in OpenTTD is the area on which the game is played. Every scenario is different, and basically features land and water.  Scenarios can be randomly generated, or can be downloaded and played. Alternatively, you can design your own scenarios and choose the setting. There exist few tools where scenarios can be generated from heightmaps. These are often used to represent real life geography. Scenario Editing was first added in Transport Tycoon World Editor, where Scenarios were referred to as '''Landscapes'''.

Scenarios have their own file extension, .SCN, and are loaded from and saved to the /scenario/ directory.

To load a scenario from the [[en/Manual/Command line]], use: "-g scenario/<name>"
