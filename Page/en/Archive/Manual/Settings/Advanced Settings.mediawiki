:''This document refers to patches in OpenTTD. '''The Patch''' may refer to Josef Drexler's [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]].''

In OpenTTD we consider certain options that affect gameplay to be patches. The name for those modifications comes from [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]] and is now used in OpenTTD as well. Most patches improve gameplay or the [[en/Manual/Game interface|interface]]. Some of them give you more power in the game. Most patches can be activated from the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches]], but for some of them you have to edit the config file, [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]].

Some features that have been patches in older versions of OpenTTD can now be found under [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Difficulty|difficulty settings]], [[en/Manual/Game options window|game options]] or [[en/Manual/Cheats]]. Some of them might even have become permanent features that you cannot disable.
