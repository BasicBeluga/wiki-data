{{en/Manual/Navigation}}

In OpenTTD we consider certain options that affect gameplay to be patches (called Advanced Settings since 0.7.x). The name for those modifications comes from [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]] and is now used in OpenTTD as well. Most patches improve gameplay or the [[en/Manual/Game interface|interface]]. Some of them give you more power in the game. Most patches can be activated from the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches]], but for some of them you have to edit the config file, [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]].

Some features that have been patches in older versions of OpenTTD can now be found under [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Difficulty|difficulty settings]], [[en/Manual/Game options window|game options]] or [[en/Manual/Cheats]]. Some of them might even have become permanent features that you cannot disable.

==Configuring the patches==
The '''configure patches window''' (0.7.x: Advanced Settings) allows you to change most of the available patches from within the game. The available patches are divided up into the following main sections:

*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Interface|Interface]]
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Construction|Construction]]
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|Vehicles]]
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Stations|Stations]]
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Economy|Economy]]
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Competitors|Competitors]]
[[File:en/Patches-Interface-0.4.0.png|right|frame|The ''Configure Patches'' window]]

Buttons are green to show the patch is on, red to show it is off. Arrow buttons change the value of the setting like a horizontal scrollbox. Clicking on a patch-line with arrow buttons shown will bring up an edit box, where the desired value can be typed in.

== Restructured advanced settings window ==

{{en/Nightly}}
[[File:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced options full.png|thumb|The fully expanded advanced settings tree]]
In nightly builds since r14275 as well as 0.7.x or higher, these patches have been renamed to "Advanced Settings" to avoid confusion with TTDPatch or patches (in the technical sense) against the source code of OpenTTD often found in the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=33 Development section of tt-forums].

Since r14974 as well as 0.7.x or higher, the tabs at the top of the window are removed and all advanced settings are listed in a tree structure. This allows for subcategories that can be expanded and collapsed independently. The former tabs (''Interface'', ''Construction'', ''Vehicles'', ''Stations'', ''Economy'' and ''Competitors'') are now top level categories and they can now have subcategories, for example the subcategory ''Trains'' in ''Vehicles''.
