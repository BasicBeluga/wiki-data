__TOC__

===Towns===
====Allow bribing of the local authority====
Allows you to [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Bribe authority|bribe the local authority]] so that they increase your rating, if you are caught though you will be fined and wonâ€™t be able to bribe them for a while.
<br />([economy] bribe = <true|false>)

====Allow buying exclusive transport rights====
Allows you to disable the purchase of exclusive transport rights in towns. Useful (to disable?) in multiplayer games.
<br />([economy]exclusive_rights = <true|false>)

====Road layout for new towns====
Select how towns should build their roads. You can choose between the original algorithm, an improved algorithm, a 2x2 grid, a 3x3 grid or random. The random setting picks one of the four option randomly for each town.
<br />([economy] town_layout = <0-4>)

====Towns are allowed to build roads====
When disabled, towns don't build roads by themselves. In order for towns to grow, you have to provide the roads yourself (somewhat like SimCity, but without the zoning and stuff).
<br />([economy] allow_town_roads = <true|false>)

====[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Remove absurd road-elements during the road construction|Remove absurd road-elements during the road construction]]====
Enable if towns should remove useless pieces of road to clean up dead ends.
<br />([economy] mod_road_rebuild = <true|false>)

====Town growth speed====
Select how fast towns should grow. You can also completely disable town growth.
<br />([economy] town_growth_rate = <0-4>)

====Proportion of towns that will become cities====
Set how many towns will become cities. Cities are larger towns which are allowed to grow faster (see also next setting).
<br />([economy] larger_towns = <0-255>)

====Initial city size multiplier====
Set how fast cities should grow.
<br />([economy] initial_city_size = <1-10>)

===Industries===
====Manual primary industry construction method====
Allows you to [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build raw material industries|construct industries]] that produce raw materials as well as industries that use them. None: cannot fund new primary industries. As other industries: can fund new primary industries. Prospecting: can fund new primary industries for same prices as secondary industries, but the industry will appear at a random place on the map, or may not appear at all.
<br />([construction] raw_industry_construction = <0-2>)

====Allow multiple similar industries per town====
A town can have [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Multiple industries per town|more than one item of a type of industry]].
<br />([economy] multiple_industry_per_town = <true|false>)

====Industries of the same type can be built close to each other====
Industries of the same type can be [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Same industries close|built close to each]] other with this patch on, it could cause problems though as you may end up with ten industries of one type in one small area of your map.
<br />([economy] same_industry_close = <true|false>)

====Max distance from edge for Oil Refineries====
This option determines the maximum allowed distance (in tiles) from the edge of the map for an Oil Refinery.
<br />([game_creation] oil_refinery_limit = <12-48>)

===Inflation===
Controls whether [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Disable inflation|inflation is on or off]]. If inflation is on, the prices of everything will increase as you progress. To balance this increase, the maximum loan available to you will increase every few years.
<br />([economy] inflation = <true|false>)

===Enable smooth economy (more, smaller changes)===
[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Smooth economy|Changes in production]] will happen more frequently and by smaller percentages.
<br />([economy] smooth_economy = <true|false>)
