==Advanced Settings window: Stations section==
{{en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings}}
The Stations section allows you to set various options related to stations. The purpose of the available settings is explained below. For each setting, the respective variable from the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg|config file]] is listed as well, together with it's possible values.

__TOC__

===Cargo handling===
====Use improved loading algorithm====
An [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Improved Loading|improved loading algorithm]], which loads only one vehicle at a time until it's completely full, before loading the next vehicle. When disabled, all vehicles in a station are loaded simultaineously, possibly needlessly blocking multiple platforms.
<br /> ([order] improved_load = <true|false>) 

====Load vehicles gradually====
Vehicles will load cargo over a period of time, not full load instantly. If the option to show [[en/Archive/Manual/Loading indicators]] is switched on, this will be reflected correctly.
<br />([order] gradual_loading = <true|false>) 

====Deliver cargo to a station only when there is a demand====
Cargo will only be generated at a station when a vehicle with the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Select goods|capacity to pick that cargo up]] has visited the station.  Affects station ratings.
<br />([order] selectgoods = <true|false>)

===Join train stations built next to each other===
Stations built next to each other will be [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Join train stations|joined]] as long as the station spread is not too high.
<br />([station] join_stations = <true|false>)

===Nonuniform stations===
Enables you to [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Nonuniform stations|join stations together at different angles]], so you can for instance have two vertical tracks and three horizontal tracks.
<br />([station] nonuniform_stations = <true|false>) 

===Allow building adjacent stations===
Holding the Ctrl key while building a [[en/Manual/Stations]] directly adjacent to another one will create new station instead of merging the new tile(s) with the existing station.
<br />([station] adjacent_stations = <true|false>)

===Allow to join stations not directly adjacent===
Holding the Ctrl key while building a [[en/Manual/Stations]] pops up a dialog asking to merge the station with an existing station within the [[en/Manual/Catchment area]] or creating a new station.
<br />([station] distant_join_stations = <true|false>)

===Max station spread===
How [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Change station spread|spread out a station can be]] from one end to the other. If you draw a square round a station, this is the maximum size of any side of the square in tiles.
<br />([station] station_spread = <num_val>)

===Allow town controlled noise level for airports===
With this activated, the number of airports which can be placed in the vicinity of a town is not fixed anymore. Instead it depends upon the noise level of the [[en/Manual/Airports]], their distance to the town centre and the town's attitude. 
<br />([economy] station_noise_level = <true|false>)

===Allow more realistically sized catchment areas===
Changes the [[en/Manual/Catchment area]] areas to be more [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Modified catchment|realistically sized]]. With this setting enabled, the catchment area of a station tile varies depending on what "type" of station tile it is. For example, train stations have a larger catchment area than bus stations and airports have even larger catchment areas. With airports, the size of the catchment area even varies with the type of airport, with the Intercontinental Airport having the largest area.
<br />([station] modified_catchment = <true|false>)

===Allow drive-through road stops on town owned roads===
It will be possible to build [[en/Manual/Drive-through Road Stops|drive-through road stops]] on [[en/Manual/Towns]] owned roads.
<br />([construction] road_stop_on_town_road = <true|false>) 

===Allow drive-through road stops on roads owned by competitors===
It will be possible to build [[en/Manual/Drive-through Road Stops|drive-through road stops]] on roads owned by [[en/Competitors|competitor]] companies.
<br />([construction] road_stop_on_competitor_road = <true|false>)
