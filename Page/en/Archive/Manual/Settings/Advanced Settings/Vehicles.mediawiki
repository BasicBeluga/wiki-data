The Construction section allows you to set various options related to trains, road vehicles, aircraft and ships. The purpose of the available settings is explained below. For each setting, the respective variable from the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg|config file]] is listed with it's possible values.

__TOC__

===Routing===
====Pathfinder for trains====
Select the pathfinding algorithm for trains. [[en/Archive/Manual/Yet Another Pathfinder]] is the default and recommended setting, but you can still select the older pathfinders.
<br />([pf] pathfinder_for_trains = <0-2>)

====Forbid trains and ships to make 90 deg turns====
Disallows trains and ships from making sharp 90 degree turns. The NPF or YAPF pathfinder for trains needs to be enabled for this option to work for trains.
<br />([pf] forbid_90_deg = <true|false>)

====Pathfinder for road vehicles====
Select the pathfinding algorithm for road vehicles. [[en/Archive/Manual/Yet Another Pathfinder]] is the default and recommended setting, but you can still select the older pathfinders.
<br />([pf] pathfinder_for_roadvehs = <0-2>)

====Road vehicle queueing (with quantum effects)====
Trucks and buses [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Road vehicle queueing|queue up]] at a busy station rather than turning around.
<br />([pf] roadveh_queue = <true|false>)

====Pathfinder for ships====
Select the pathfinding algorithm for ships. The original is the default and recommended setting, but you can select newer pathfinder. YAPF for ships has the advantage of not having to use buoys for long distances, but has serious performance issues when using a large number of ships (i.e. more than ten).
<br />([pf] pathfinder_for_ships = <0-2>)

===Autorenew===
====Autorenew vehicle when it gets old====
Vehicles are [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|automatically replaced]] when they get old, provided that the same vehicle type is still available for purchase.
<br />([gui] autorenew = <true|false>)

====Autorenew when vehicle is ... months before/after max age====
[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|Autorenew months]] defines when the renew will be done. If value is set negative, vehicles will be renewed before they reach their maximum age.
<br />([gui] autorenew_months = <-12-12>)

====Autorenew minimum needed money for renew====
[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|Autorenew money]] defines the minimum amount of money needed before autorenew is done. If you have less cash than set here, autorenew will be suspended until you have enough money again.
<br />([gui] autorenew_money = <0-2000000>)

===Servicing===
====Service intervals are in percents====
When this switch is on the service intervals are considered to be in percents of the max. reliability rather than days. For example, if an engine has the max reliability of 80% and you set the service interval to 10% then it will go to depot at 72%.
<br />([vehicle] servint_ispercent = <true|false>)

====Default service interval for trains====
The default service interval when a new [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval trains|train]] is built.
<br />([vehicle] servint_trains = <0, 5-800)

====Default service interval for road vehicles====
The default service interval when a new [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval road vehicles|road vehicle]] is built.
<br />([vehicle] servint_roadveh = <0, 5-800)

====Default service interval for ships====
The default service interval when a new [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval ships|ship]] is built.
<br />([vehicle] servint_ships = <0, 5-800)

====Default service interval for aircraft====
The default service interval when a new [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval aircraft|aircraft]] is built.
<br />([vehicle] servint_aircraft = <0, 5-800)

====Disable servicing when breakdowns set to none====
If you have breakdowns set to none and have this switch on, your vehicles will never go to the depot for a service.
Even if this setting is enabled, vehicles will still go to depot for auto-renewal and/or replacement if those settings are activated.
<br />([order] no_servicing_if_no_breakdowns = <true|false>)

====Service helicopters at helipads automatically====
When enabled, helicopters will be serviced automatically each time they arrive at a helipad. This way, you don't need to have some airport along the helicopter's route for it to service.
<br />([order] serviceathelipad = <true|false>)


===Trains===
====Train accelleration model====
Select the default or a more [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Realistic acceleration]] calculation for trains. With this setting set to ''realistic'', trains will travel faster up hill, but slower through tight corners.
<br />([vehicle] train_acceleration_model = <0-1>)

====Enable building very long trains====
You can build extremely long trains, aka [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Mammoth trains]].
<br />([vehicle] mammoth_trains = <true|false>)

====Warn if train is lost====
A train will be [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Train is lost warning|reported lost]] if it cannot find a route to the station it is currently heading to.
<br />([gui] lost_train_warn = <true|false>)

====Enable wagon speed limits====
Some [[en/Manual/NewGRF]]'s have wagon speed limits to make them more realistic, this option will enable/disable them.
<br />([vehicle] wagon_speed_limits = <true|false>)

====Disable electric rails====
Disables electrified railways. The electric trains will run on normal tracks when this setting is active and electrified railways are not available for purchase.
<br />([vehicle] disable_elrails = <true|false>)

====Weight multiplier for freight to simulate heavy trains====
The weight of freight trains is multiplied by the multiplier set here to simulate very heavy trains for more realism.
<br />([vehicle] freight_trains = <1-255>)
