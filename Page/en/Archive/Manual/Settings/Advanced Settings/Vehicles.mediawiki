The Construction section allows you to set various options related to trains, road vehicles, aircraft and ships. The purpose of the available settings is explained below. For each setting, the respective variable from the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg|config file]] is listed with it's possible values.

__TOC__

===Routing===
====Pathfinder for trains====
Select the pathfinding algorithm for trains. [[en/Archive/Manual/Yet Another Pathfinder]] is the default and recommended setting, but you can still select the older pathfinders.
<br />([pf] pathfinder_for_trains = <0-2>)

====Forbid trains and ships to make 90 deg turns====
Disallows trains and ships from making sharp 90 degree turns. The NPF or YAPF pathfinder for trains needs to be enabled for this option to work for trains.
<br />([pf] forbid_90_deg = <true|false>)

====Pathfinder for road vehicles====
Select the pathfinding algorithm for road vehicles. [[en/Archive/Manual/Yet Another Pathfinder]] is the default and recommended setting, but you can still select the older pathfinders.
<br />([pf] pathfinder_for_roadvehs = <0-2>)

====Road vehicle queueing (with quantum effects)====
Trucks and buses [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Road vehicle queueing|queue up]] at a busy station rather than turning around.
<br />([pf] roadveh_queue = <true|false>)

====Pathfinder for ships====
Select the pathfinding algorithm for ships. The original is the default and recommended setting, but you can select newer pathfinder. YAPF for ships has the advantage of not having to use buoys for long distances, but has serious performance issues when using a large number of ships (i.e. more than ten).
<br />([pf] pathfinder_for_ships = <0-2>)

===Autorenew===
====Autorenew vehicle when it gets old====
Vehicles are [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|automatically replaced]] when they get old, provided that the same vehicle type is still available for purchase.
<br />([gui] autorenew = <true|false>)

====Autorenew when vehicle is ... months before/after max age====
[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|Autorenew months]] defines when the renew will be done. If value is set negative, vehicles will be renewed before they reach their maximum age.
<br />([gui] autorenew_months = <-12-12>)

====Autorenew minimum needed money for renew====
[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|Autorenew money]] defines the minimum amount of money needed before autorenew is done. If you have less cash than set here, autorenew will be suspended until you have enough money again.
<br />([gui] autorenew_money = <0-2000000>)
