'''Allow goto depot orders''' is a [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|setting]] that allows player to put a depot in a vehicles [[en/Manual/Orders]]. 

== Description ==
[[File:fr/Archive/Manual/Settings/Go To Depot.png|right|frame|"Go to depot" order in the vehicle's order list]]
When enabled, this option lets you include a depot in a [[en/Manual/Orders|vehicle's orders]]. This is useful for compulsory servicing at a particular point in the orders (maybe before a complicated junction you definitely don't want a train breaking down at).

== How to use goto depot order ==
You can just order the vehicle to go to a depot, like with a station, and the vehicle will visit that depot when it sees that order in its list before continuing, much like any other [[en/Manual/Waypoints]] or station in its orders. 

When you select a go to depot order in the order list, the "Full Load" and "Unload" instruction buttons in the order windows will respectively change to "Service" and "Refit" ones.

If you do not want that the vehicle will visit the depot every order list's cycle, use the ''Service'' instruction: the go to depot order is ignored if the servicing intervall is not expired yet.

If you want that the vehicle will be [[en/Manual/Refit|refitted]] at the depot, press the ''Refit'' instruction button. A screen will pop-up, showing the refit options for that vehicle.
