When enabled, this option lets you include a depot in a vehicle's orders. This is useful for compulsory servicing. You can just an order to the vehicle and click on a depot and the vehicle will visit that depot when it sees that order in its list before continuing, much like any other [[en/Manual/Waypoints]] or station in its orders.
