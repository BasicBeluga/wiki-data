[[en/Community/Patches/Patches]] that that allows player to put a depot in a vehicles [[en/Manual/Orders]]. 

== Description ==
When enabled, this option lets you include a depot in a [[en/Manual/Orders|vehicle's orders]]. This is useful for compulsory servicing. You can just order the vehicle to go to a depot, like with a station, and the vehicle will visit that depot when it sees that order in its list before continuing, much like any other [[en/Manual/Waypoints]] or station in its orders.
