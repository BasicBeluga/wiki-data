When enabled, this option lets you include a depot in a vehicle's orders.  This is useful for compulsory servicing.  You can just an order to the vehicle and click on a depot and the vehicle will visit a depot when it sees that order in it's list before continuing, much like any other checkpoint or station in its orders.
