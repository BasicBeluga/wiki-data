This [[en/Community/Patches/Patches|patch]] allows you to build small airports at anytime in the game.

== Description ==

Under normal circumstances, as the game progresses, small airports become grayed out and can no longer be built. This can be a pain if you wish to build an airport but don't have the space for a city airport. If this patch is enabled, you will always be able to build small airports.
