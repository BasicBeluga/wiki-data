A new variable, <code>autoclean_novehicles</code>, was introduced in version 0.7.0, which specifies the amount of months after which an inactive company without vehicles is removed, regardless of the password setting. This is to prevent players from creating 'empty' companies.

[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Autoclean companies]] must be enabled for this option to work.

Max value: 256 months (about 21 in-game years or 4.8 real-life hours)

Please note that setting this value to 0 disables this feature.
