[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Bribe authority]]
A [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|setting]] that allows you to bribe local authorities.

== Description ==
When you enable this patch, an option is added to the [[en/Manual/Local authority]] window allowing you to bribe the local authority in attempt to raise your company rating in that locality. Bribe with caution, however, as many transport companies have been caught out by the [[en/Archive/Manual/Regional Investigator|regional investigators]] who look very poorly upon this behaviour. {{en/Note|You can not bribe local authorities to raise your company rating above 'Excellent'}}

== Use ==
This feature is enabled by default. Disable this patch through either the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Construction|configure patches -> economy]] window or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:
<pre>[patches]
bribe = false</pre>

== Penalty ==
If you get caught, you won't be able to use the actions on the local authority where you got caught for a year.
