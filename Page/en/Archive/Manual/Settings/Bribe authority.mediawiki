[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Bribe authority]]
A [[en/Community/Patches/Patches]] that allows you to bribe local authorities.

== Description ==
When you enable this patch, an option is added to the [[en/Manual/Local authority]] window allowing you to bribe the local authority in attempt to raise your company rating in that locality. Bribe with caution, however, as many transport companies have been caught out by the regional investigators who look very poorly upon this behaviour. (Note: you can not bribe local authorities to raise your company rating above 'Excellent')

== Use ==
This feature is disabled by default. Either enable this patch through the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Construction|configure patches -> construction]] window or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:
<pre>[patches]
bribe = true</pre>
