[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build in pause]]
Build in pause allows you to build while the game is paused. This is very handy when you're rebuilding a huge [[en/Manual/Stations|station]] or a mainline in your network while not wanting to disrupt any [[en/Manual/Trains]] running on it.

It is considered a [[en/Manual/Cheats|cheat]].

== Using the cheat ==
Press Ctrl + Alt + C and select "Build while in pause mode".
