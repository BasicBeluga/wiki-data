[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build in pause]]
'''Build in pause''' allows you to build while the game is paused. This is very handy when you're rebuilding a huge [[en/Manual/Stations|station]] or a mainline in your network while not wanting to disrupt any [[en/Manual/Trains]] running on it. This can also help to prevent crashes.  This cheat will only work in a non-network game, as of course, there is no cheating in network games.  '''Build in pause''' also allows you to use the dynamite tool while in pause.

It is considered a [[en/Manual/Cheats|cheat]].
== Using the cheat ==
Press Ctrl + Alt + C and select "Build while in pause mode".
