[[Category:en/Manual/Construction]]

This [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|setting]] will enable you to purchase and either prospect or place industries which create raw materials.

== Description ==
[[File:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Raw industry construction basic.png|right|frame|The standard fund new industry menu]]
[[File:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Raw industry construction extended.png|right|frame|The extended fund new industry menu]]

Normally, you are only allowed to [[en/Manual/Industries|purchase industries]] which process materials, e.g. Factories, Sawmills, etc.  When this setting is enabled, you are also allowed to build raw-material producing industries such as coal mines, iron ore mines, etc.

When the [[en/Manual/Industries#prospecting-new-industries|prospecting construction method]] is selected, you will be able to purchase a new industry of the selected type, but the industry will appear in a random location on the map. There is a chance that prospection may fail, which means that the money will be spent, but the industry will not be constructed.

This does not affect which types of "naturally occurring" industries show up, just which ones you are able to purchase.

== Use ==

Construction of primary industries is disabled by default.  When enabled, the list of industries you can purchase will include industries which produce the raw materials, with appropriate pricing. You can enable this setting through the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Economy#manual-primary-industry-construction-method|Advanced Settings -> Economy -> Industries -> Manual primary industry construction method]] window or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:

<pre>
[construction]
raw_industry_construction = 2
</pre>

0 = none, 1 = as other industries, 2 = prospecting

Valid options: [ 0 | 1 | 2 ]

Default: 0

It can also be set in the console using the command (single player games only):

<pre>
set raw_industry_construction <value>
</pre>

With inflation, the cost of specific industries will rise (or have already risen).
The costs shown are the costs to build the industry assuming you can choose the location where you want the industry to be built. If the prospecting method is enabled, the costs are divided by a factor of 8 (approximately).
