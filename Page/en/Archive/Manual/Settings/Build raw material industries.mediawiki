[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build raw material industries]]
This [[en/Community/Patches/Patches|patch]] will enable you to purchase and place industries which create raw materials.

== Description ==

Normally, you are only allowed to purchase industries which process materials, e.g. Factories, Sawmills, etc.  When this patch is enabled you are also allowed to build raw-material producing industries such as coal mines, iron mines, etc.

This does not affect which types of "naturally occurring" industries which show up, just which ones you are able to purchase.

== Use ==

This patch is disabled by default.  When enabled, the list of industries you can purchase will include industries which produce the raw materials, with appropriate pricing.
