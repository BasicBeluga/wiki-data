[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Change station spread]]
A [[en/Community/Patches/Patches]] that allows you to change the maximum size of a station.

== Description ==
The station spread is the maximum distance between two station tiles. There is a limit to how spread a station is allowed to be. If the station already covers this amount of tiles in a certain direction, you cannot add any other part to the station is this direction. With this patch you can change the maximum station size to anything between 4 and 64 tiles. Be careful though: The game becomes very unstable when you set this value any higher than 12, which is the default value.

== Use ==
The default station spread is 12. You can change this value through the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Stations|configure patches -> stations]] window or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:
<pre>[patches]
station_spread = 12</pre>
