A [[en/Community/Patches/Patches]] that allows you to change the maximum size of a station.

==Description==
The station spread is the maximum distance between two station tiles. There is a limit to how spread a station is allowed to be. If the station already covers this amount of tiles in a certain direction, you cannot add any other part to the station in this direction. With this patch you can change the maximum station size to anything between 4 and 64 tiles, the maximum value being larger than the longest train you can have, about 50 tiles. Be careful though: The game becomes very unstable when you set this value any higher than 12, which is the default value.

what do you mean by "very unstable"? Only slow? Or crashing on you?

==Use==
The default station spread is 12. You can change this value through the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Stations|configure patches -> stations]] window or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:
<pre>[patches]
station_spread = 12</pre>
