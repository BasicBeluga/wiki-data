A [[en/Community/Patches/Patches]] that changes the date when coloured newspaper messages are being displayed.

== Description ==
This patch is a purely cosmetic change that allows the newspaper messages to be printed in colour after a certain date, supposedly to coincide with the use of coloured ink in newspaper printing.

== Use ==
This feature is set to 2000 by default. You can change it through either the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Economy|configure patches -> Economy]] window or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:

colored_news_year = 2000</pre>
