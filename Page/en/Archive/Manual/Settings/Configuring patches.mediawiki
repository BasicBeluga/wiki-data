The '''configure patches window''' Contains a number of detailed settings ([[en/Community/Patches/Patches]]) you can change in the game, divided up into the following sections:

*[[{{PAGENAME}}/Interface|Interface]]
*[[{{PAGENAME}}/Construction|Construction]]
*[[{{PAGENAME}}/Vehicles|Vehicles]]
*[[{{PAGENAME}}/Stations|Stations]]
*[[{{PAGENAME}}/Economy|Economy]]
*[[{{PAGENAME}}/Competitors|Competitors]]

Buttons are green to show the patch is on, red to show it is off. Arrow buttons change the value of the setting like a horizontal scrollbox. Clicking on a patch-line with arrow buttons shown will bring up an edit box, where the desired value can be typed in.

{{en/Nightly}}
In nightly builds after 0.6.0 (please add revision number), these settings have been renamed to "Advanced Settings" to avoid confusion with TTDPatch or patches (in the technical sense) against the source code of OpenTTD often found in the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=33 Development section of tt-forums].
The functionality remains the same.
