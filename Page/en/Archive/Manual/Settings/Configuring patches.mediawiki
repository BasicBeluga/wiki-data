The '''configure patches window''' Contains a number of detailed settings ([[en/Community/Patches/Patches]]) you can change in the game, divided up into the following sections:

*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Interface|Interface]]
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Construction|Construction]]
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Vehicles|Vehicles]]
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Stations|Stations]]
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Economy|Economy]]
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Competitors|Competitors]]

Buttons are green to show the patch is on, red to show it is off. Arrow buttons change the value of the setting like a horizontal scrollbox. Clicking on a patch-line with arrow buttons shown will bring up an edit box, where the desired value can be typed in.
