==Configure Patches Window: Economy Section==
The Economy section allows you to set various options related to the
[[File:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/0.6.0 configurepatches competitors.png|frame|center|The Configure Patches > Competitors window (0.6.0)]]

====Enable New AI (alpha)====
(ainew_active) Whether the [[en/Archive/Development/New AI]] is enabled or disabled.

====Allow AIs in multiplayer (experimental)====
(ai_in_multiplayer) Enables new AI in multiplayer games (requires to have Enable New AI (alpha) on)

====Disable trains / road vehicles / aircraft / ships / for computer====

(ai_disable_veh_train/ai_disable_veh_roadveh/ai_disable_veh_aircraft/ai_disable_veh_ship)
The AI competitors are not allowed to use this type of vehicle when the patch is enabled. This also applies to the underlying infrastructure. So if the AI is not allowed to build [[en/Manual/Base Set/Road Vehicles/Buses]], it will not build roads either. If [[#enable-new-ai-alpha|the new AI is '''enabled''']], disabling [[en/Manual/Trains]], [[en/Manual/Aircraft]], and [[en/Manual/Ships]] will have no effect, but disabling road vehicles will essentially destroy the AI's ability to compete (as it cannot yet build any of the previous three).
