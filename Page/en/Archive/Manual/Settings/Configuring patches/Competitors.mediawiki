====Enable New AI (alpha)====
(ainew_active) Whether the [[en/Archive/Development/New AI]] is enabled or disabled.

====Allow AIs in multiplayer (experimental)====
{{en/Expand|information needed}}

====Disable trains / road vehicles / aircraft / ships / for computer====

(ai_disable_veh_train/ai_disable_veh_roadveh/ai_disable_veh_aircraft/ai_disable_veh_ship)
The AI competitors are not allowed to use this type of vehicle when the patch is enabled. This also applies to the underlying infrastructure. So if the AI is not allowed to build [[en/Manual/Base Set/Road Vehicles/Buses]], it will not build roads either. If [[#enable-new-ai-alpha|the new AI is '''enabled''']], disabling [[en/Manual/Trains]], [[en/Manual/Aircraft]], and [[en/Manual/Ships]] will have no effect, but disabling road vehicles will essentially destroy the AI's ability to compete (as it cannot yet build any of the previous three).
