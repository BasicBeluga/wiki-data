====Enable New AI (alpha)====
(ainew_active) Whether the [[en/New competitor AI]] is enabled or disabled.

====Disable trains / road vehicles / aircraft / ships / for computer====

(ai_disable_veh_train/ai_disable_veh_roadveh/ai_disable_veh_aircraft/ai_disable_veh_ship)
The AI competitors are not allowed to use this type of vehicle when the patch is enabled. This also applies to the underlying infrastructure. So if the AI is not allowed to build buses, it will not build roads either. If the new AI is enabled, disabling trains, aircraft, and ships will have no effect, but disabling road vehicles will essentially destroy the AI's ability to compete (as it cannot yet build any of the previous three)
