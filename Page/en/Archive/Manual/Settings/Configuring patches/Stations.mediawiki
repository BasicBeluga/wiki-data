====Join train stations built next to each other====
Stations built next to each other will be [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Join train stations|joined]] as long as the station spread is not too high.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>

====Leave station when any cargo is full, if ‘full load’====
When this patch is enabled the vehicle will leave when [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Full load any cargo|any cargo is fully loaded]]. If you use lots of planes to transport passengers and mail you may want to disable this patch.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>

====Use improved loading algorithm====
An [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Improved Loading|improved loading algorithm]] (which load only one vehicle and only after it is full and ready to go start loading next), as opposed to the old balanced loading algorithm.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>

====Deliver cargo to a station only when there is demand====
Cargo will only be generated at a station when a vehicle with the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Select goods|capacity to pick that cargo up]] has visited the station.  Affects station ratings.

====TTDPatch compatible non-stop handling====
[[en/Archive/Manual/Non-stop|Non stop handling]] similar to that of TTDPatch.
When this option is enabled, trains don't stop except where ordered (there's an implied non-stop on every "go to...") and an explicit non-stop order allows a train to use a station as a waypoint, without stopping.  See [http://wiki.ttdpatch.net/tiki-index.php?page=NewNonstopHandling TTDPatch NewNonstopHandling page] for more information.

====Service helicopters at helipads====
Helicopters will be [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service at helipad|serviced at helipads]] so they don’t need an airport in their orders, but you need to build helicopters from airport.
:''Possible Settings:'' <span style="color:green">'''On'''</span> or <span style="color:red">'''Off'''</span>
:''In [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]] config file:'' (service_at_helipad)

==== Allow building adjacent stations ====
Using CTRL, while building [[en/Manual/Stations]] directly adjacent to one another will form new station.
