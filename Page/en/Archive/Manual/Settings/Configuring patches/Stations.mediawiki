====Join train stations built next to each other====
(join_stations) Stations built next to each other will be [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Join train stations|joined]] as long as the station spread is not too high.

====Leave station when any cargo is full, if ‘full load’====
(full_load_any) When this patch is enabled the vehicle will leave when [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Full load any cargo|any cargo is fully loaded]]. If you use lots of planes to transport passengers and mail you may want to disable this patch.

====Use improved loading algorithm====
(improved_load) A [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Improved Loading|FIFO loading algorithm]], as opposed to the old balanced loading algorithm.

====Deliver cargo to a station only when there is demand====
(selectgoods) Cargo will only be generated at a station when a vehicle with the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Select goods|capacity to pick that cargo up]] has visited the station.  Affects station ratings.

====TTDPatch compatible non-stop handling====
(new_nonstop) [[en/Archive/Manual/Non-stop|Non stop handling]] similar to that of TTDPatch, see [http://wiki.ttdpatch.net/tiki-index.php?page=NewNonstopHandling TTDPatch NewNonstopHandling page] for more information.

====Non uniform stations====
(nonuniform_stations) Enables you to [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Nonuniform stations|join stations together at different angles]], so you can have two vertical tracks and three horizontal tracks.

====Max station spread====
(station_spread) How [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Change station spread|spread out a station can be]] from one end to the other.

====Service helicopters at helipads====
(service_at_helipad) Helicopters will be [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service at helipad|serviced at helipads]] so they don’t need an airport in their orders, but you need to build helicopters from airport.

====Allow more realistically sized catchment areas====
