This window of the [[en/Manual/Main Page]] patches section enables you to set various settings that affect vehicles and their behaviour. This is also the place to disable that pesky AI building busses and roads all over the place :D

=Configure Patches Window: Vehicles Section=
<center>[[File:en/Patches-vehicles.png|center|frame|1. - The Configure patches window; Vehicles]]</center>

====Enable realistic acceleration for trains====
Enables a more [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Realistic acceleration]] calculation for trains.

====Enable building very long trains====
You can build extremly long trains, aka [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Mammoth trains]].

====No automatic train servicing====
Trains are [[en/No automatic train service|not automatically serviced]], if you want them to be serviced you will need to give them a go to depot order.

====Allow goto depot orders====
All vehicles can have a [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Allow goto depot orders|depot in their schedule]].

====Road vehicle queuing====
Trucks [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Road vehicle queueing|queue up]] at a busy station rather than turning around.

====New depot finding====
Enables the new algorithm for [[en/New depot finding|depot finding]].

====New algorithm for train path finding====
Enables the new algorithm for [[en/New pathfinding|train path finding]].

====Warn if a train's income is negative====
If a train's [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Train income warning|income is negative]] it will be reported in a news message. At the moment there is no option for all vehicles to get revenue in a [[en/Manual/Feeder service]] so you may want to turn this off.

====Vehicles never expire====
Old vehicles will stay in the vehicle list for you to choose and [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Never expire vehicles|never become obsolete]].

====A train is lost if no progress is made for (x days)====
A train will be [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Train is lost warning|reported lost]] if the station it is currently heading to has not been reached in this amount of time.

====Auto renew vehicle when it gets old====
Vehicles are [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|automatically replaced]] when they get old.

[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|Autorenew months]] defines when the renew will be done.

[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|Autorenew money]] defines the minimum amount of money needed before autorenew is done.

====Max trains / road vehicles / aircraft / ships per player====
How many vehicles of each type a player can have ([[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Max trains|trains]], [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Max trains|trains]], [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Max road vehicles|road vehicles]], [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Max aircraft|aircraft]], [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Max ships|ships]]).

====Service intervals are in percents====
When this switch is on the service intervals are considered to be in percents of the max. reliability rather than days. For example, if an engine has the max reliability of 80% and you set the service interval to 10% then it will go to depot at 72%.

Note: you can hold the Ctrl key while changing service intervals to change them in increments of 5 rather than 10.

====Default service interval for trains / road vehicles / aircraft / ships====
The default service interval for each vehicle type when a new one is built ([[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval trains|trains]], [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval trains|trains]], [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval road vehicles|road vehicles]], [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval aircraft|aircraft]], [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval ships|ships]]).

====Disable trains / road vehicles / aircraft / ships / for computer====
The AI competitors are [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Disable AI vehicles|not allowed to use this type of vehicle]] when the patch is enabled. This also applies to the underlying infrastructure. So if the AI is not allowed to build busses, it will not build roads either.
