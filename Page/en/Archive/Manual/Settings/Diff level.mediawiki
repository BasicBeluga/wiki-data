[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Diff level]]
The diff_level entry in the openttd.cfg file sets the pre-defined difficulty levels in the game.
Valid options are 0 for easy-mode, 1 for normal-mode, 2 for hard-mode and 3 for custom difficulty.
You can edit the custom difficulty by changing the values of the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Diff custom]] entry.
