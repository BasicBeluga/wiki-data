It is possible to change the '''difficulty options''' on your game by using this dialog. Some options can only be changed before the game has started. Three preset difficulty settings can be toggled by pressing the buttons at the top of the dialog (Easy, Medium and Hard), or customize (Custom button).

__NOTOC__

==Easy, Medium, Hard, Custom, Default==
Preset difficulty levels. Select one of these to choose how difficult the game will be. You can also change levels by pressing the left and right arrows. Altering any of the settings from the presets of any of the three difficulties will change the difficulty to "Custom" instead.

==Different Setting areas==
===Maximum no. competitors===
This is the maximum number of AI or computer players allowed.

===No. of towns===
This can be set in two places (here in difficulty settings or in the new terragenesis panel) when set to high you will have lots of towns and more passengers.

===No. of industries===
This is as the towns but this is for industries. This can be found on the ''generate map dialog'' too.

===Maximum initial loan===
This is the maximum loan you can have at the start of the game.

===Initial interest rate===
This is the % of the loan you will be paying each game year. This doesn't pay off the loan itself.

===Vehicle running costs===
This is the cost per game year that all your vehicles have to pay. 

===Construction speed of competitors===
This is how fast the AI competitors build.

===Vehicle Breakdowns===
This is how often your vehicles breakdown.

===Subsidy Multiplier===
How much the income is multiplied on a subsidy service.

===Cost of construction===
This is how expensive it is for you to build anything.

===Terrain type===
How the land is formed from flat to mountainous. This can be found on the ''generate map dialog'' too.

===Quantity of sea/lakes===
This is how much of the map is taken up by the water. This can be found on the ''generate map dialog'' too.

===Economy===
If the economy isn't set to steady, it may go into a recession, which causes the industries to produce only half as much then usual. 

===Train reversing===
This specifies where the train turns around.

===Disasters===
This specifies if [[en/Manual/Disasters]] are on or off.

===City council attitude towards area restructuring===
This is how willing a local authority is to let you build near and in their town.

==In previous versions==
===Intelligence of competitors===
How intelligent the AI competitors are at building their tracks and running their company. (version?)

===Competitor start time===
This is how long after you have started your company the AIs will start. (version?)
