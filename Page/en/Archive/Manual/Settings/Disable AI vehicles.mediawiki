These patches allow you to select which [[en/Manual/Vehicles|vehicles]] the AI players are allowed to use in game. You can stop the AI using any type of vehicle, e.g. [[en/Manual/Ships|ships]] or [[en/Manual/Trains|trains]], so that if you want to play an entirely [[en/Manual/Ships|water-based-vehicle]] game you can.
