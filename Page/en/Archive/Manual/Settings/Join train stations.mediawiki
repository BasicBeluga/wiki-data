[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Join train stations]]
A [[en/Community/Patches/Patches]] that allows you to build a new train station right next to an existing one.


== Description ==
Already have a train station and want to add another platform? Or you want to make the platforms longer without rebuilding the whole station? Than you have to enable this patch! Any platforms you add have to be the same length as the original station. And if you want to make the platforms longer you have to attach a station with the same amount of platforms.

Note: A good complement to this patch is [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Nonuniform stations]], which allow you to build any weird station you can imagine


== Use ==
This feature is enabled by default. You can disable this patch through the [[en/ConfigureStationsPatches|configure patches -> stations]] window or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:
<pre>[patches]
join_stations = false</pre>

== Hints & tips ==
With [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes]] enabled you can even have multileveled stations
