[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Mammoth trains]]
A [[en/Community/Patches/Patches|patch]] that allows you to add up to 100 [[en/Manual/Trains|wagons]] to your [[en/Manual/Trains|train]].

== Description ==
Without this patch, you can only add a maximum of 9 wagons to a train. If you enabe mammoth trains, this limit is raised to 100 which should be more than sufficent. The train depot window was enhanced with a horizontal scroll bar in order to display all of the additional wagons. Don't forget that mammoth trains are extremly slow due to all the additional weight. 

== Use ==
This feature is enabled by default. You can disable this patch through the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Vehicles|configure patches -> vehicles]] window or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:
