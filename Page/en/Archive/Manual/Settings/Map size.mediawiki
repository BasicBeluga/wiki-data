[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Map size]]
'''map_x''' and '''map_y''' determine the size of the map. Each of these is calculated using the following arithmetic:

'''2 ^ map_x = number of tiles x''',<br>
'''2 ^ map_y = number of tiles y''',<br>
'''tiles x * tiles y = total mapsize'''

The ^ symbol means 'to the power of', so 2 to the power of map_x and map_y.

For example: Map_x = 10 = 1024 fields on the x-axis, map_x = 9 = 512 tiles on the x-axis.

Minimum value is 6, maximum is 11 for both.
