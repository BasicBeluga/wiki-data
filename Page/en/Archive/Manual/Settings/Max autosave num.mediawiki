[[Category:en/Patch Settings]]

This [[en/Community/Patches/Patches|patch]] defines maximum number of automaticly saved games (autosaves) in \OpenTTD\save\autosave\ directory.  

== Description ==

[[en/Manual/Main Page]] can automaticly save game every set period of time. Naturally, more saved games means much more disk space used. This [[en/Community/Patches/Patches|patch]] limits the game to number of saved games

If there are all savegame slots already used, older savegames will be overwritten

This setting is not used if [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Keep all autosaves]] is used

== Use ==

The value is set to 16 by default. You can change it by using the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:
<pre>[patches]
max_autosave_num = value</pre>
