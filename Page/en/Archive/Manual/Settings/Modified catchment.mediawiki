[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Modified catchment]]


With this setting enabled, the catchment area around a 'station' varies depending on what type of station it is.  For example, train stations have a larger catchment area than bus stations and airports' catchment areas are bigger still. It even varies with the type of airport; Intercontinental Airports have the biggest.

The catchment areas are as follows.

	CA_BUS Station = 3,
	CA_TRUCK Station = 3,
	CA_AIR_OILPAD (Helipad on oil rig) = 3,
	CA_TRAIN Station = 4,
	CA_AIR_HELIPORT = 4,
	CA_AIR_SMALL Airport = 4,
	CA_AIR_LARGE (airport) = 5,
	CA_DOCK = 5,
	CA_AIR_METRO (metropolitan) = 6,
	CA_AIR_INTERNATIONL = 8,
        CA_AIR_INTERCONTINENTAL = 10,
