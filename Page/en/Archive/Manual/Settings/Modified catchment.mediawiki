[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Modified catchment]]


With this setting enabled, the catchment area around a 'station' varies depending on what type of station it is.  For example, train stations have a larger catchment area than bus stations and airports' catchment areas are bigger still. It even varies with the type of airport; Intercontinental Airports have the biggest.

The catchment areas are as follows.

  Road stations: 3
  Rail stations: 4
  Ship docks:    5
  [[en/Manual/Airports]]: defaults vary from 1..10, also NewGRF-configurable.
