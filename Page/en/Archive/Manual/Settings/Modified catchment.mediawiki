[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Modified catchment]]
With this patch enabled, the catchment varies depending on what type of "station" it is.  For example, train stations have a larger catchment area than bus stations and airports are bigger still. It even varies with the type of airport, Intercontinental Airports have the biggest.

The catchment areas are as follows.

	CA_BUS Station = 3,
	CA_TRUCK Station = 3,
	CA_AIR_OILPAD (Helipad on oilrig) = 3,
	CA_TRAIN Station = 4,
	CA_AIR_HELIPORT = 4,
	CA_AIR_SMALL Airport = 4,
	CA_AIR_LARGE (airport) = 5,
	CA_DOCK = 5,
	CA_AIR_METRO (metropolitan) = 6,
	CA_AIR_INTERNATIONAl = 8,
