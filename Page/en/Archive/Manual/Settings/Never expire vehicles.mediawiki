[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Never expire vehicles]]
This [[en/Community/Patches/Patches|patch]] will stop vehicles from going "out of date" and so they will remain available until the very end of the game.  

== Description ==

Normally, vehicles have a limited shelf life as well as a limited in-use life.  When their shelf life expires, they are no longer available to purchase or replace and any vehicles of that type in play will slowly deteriorate.

This patch makes sure that vehicles are always available.  Thus, you can keep a Kirby steam engine and run it next to a shiny new monorail.  

== Use ==

This patch is disabled by default.  

Note that the reliabilty of the vehicles is not affected by this patch, so the older vehicles may be quite unreliable.
