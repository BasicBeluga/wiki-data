[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Never expire vehicles]]
This patch will stop vehicles from going "out of date" and so they will remain available until the very end of the game.  Thus, you can keep a Kirby steam engine and run it next to a shiny new monorail.  Note that the reliabilty of the vehicles is not affected by this patch, so the older vehicles may be quite unreliable.
