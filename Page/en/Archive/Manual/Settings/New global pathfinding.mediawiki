New global PathFinder (NPF) global pathfinder which works for all vehicles. Uses an A* algorithm to find its route. It's fast, it's good and will always return the best results. However if your network setup is really crappy it can be a bit CPU-consuming, so on older machines (and bigmaps with lots of trains), it might lower performance and thus can be disabled.  If this is the case, then you should probably at least enable [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/New train pathfinding|New Train Pathfinding (NTP)]].
