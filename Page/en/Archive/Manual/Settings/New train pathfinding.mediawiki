NTP: 'New TrainpathFinder': An improvement on the original TTD pathfinder that does not always present the best choice, looses your trains, but has worked fine for 10 years and most of us have learned to live with it. It is always advisable to turn this on since it IS better than the old one and doesn't consume any more resources. The alternative is to enable [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/New global pathfinding|New global Path Finding (NPF)]].  Enabling NPF will override this option.
