[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Nonuniform stations]]
== What does it do? ==
Nonuniform stations are stations that take up shapes that just that: nonuniform.
In the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe, all platforms of a station had to be of the same lenght, they all had to be in the same direction and the platforms should all be positioned neatly next to each other.

The Nonuniform Stations feature in OpenTTD changes this. Thanks to this feature, every platform can be of a different length, and do not have to be in the same direction nor in a neat row, like so:<br>

== How do you use it? ==
By simply placing all the different parts next to each other you create nonuniform stations.
