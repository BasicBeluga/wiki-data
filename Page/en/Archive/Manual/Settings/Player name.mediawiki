[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Player name]]

{{en/Note|Newer versions call this option <code>client_name</code>}}
This property defines the name you will have when you play [[en/Manual/Multiplayer]]. It is considered polite not to leave the name as 'Player'. It doesn't have to be anything special - possibly your nickname, forename, or initials. Use your imagination.
