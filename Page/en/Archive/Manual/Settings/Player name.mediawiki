[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Player name]]


{{en/Note|Newer versions call this option <code>client_name</code>}}
Defines the name you will have when you play [[en/Manual/Multiplayer]]. It is considered polite not to leave the name as 'Player'. It doesn't have to be anything special, possibly your nickname, forename, initals, or use your imagination.

first open the [[en/Manual/Console]], then enter:

, replacing <yournewplayername> by your name.
