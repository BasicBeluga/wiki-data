Quick Goto is an option available since r14827.
It can be found in the "Interface" tab of the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings]] window.

If enabled, the "Go to" button will be activated automatically on opening the order window if the vehicle has less than two orders already. Furthermore, the "Go to" button will stay active when clicking on a station/waypoint/depot so one can fill in multiple orders without having to click the button for each.
