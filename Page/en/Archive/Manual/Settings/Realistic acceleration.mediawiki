[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Realistic acceleration]]
This patch turns on a simple physics-based acceleration model. Depending on the weight of the vehicle, the power of the engine and the gradient of the slope it's going up or down, the acceleration is changed.
Although this is more realistic than the original TTD's interpretation, it's not perfect.
