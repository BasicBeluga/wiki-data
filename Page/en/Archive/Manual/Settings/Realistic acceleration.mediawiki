[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Realistic acceleration]]
This patch turns on a simple physics-based acceleration.  Depending on the weight of the vehicle, the power of the engine and the gradient of the slope it's going up or down, the acceleration is changed.  Although this is more realistic than the original TTD's interpretation, it's not perfect.  Also, you need to be careful because with this option, it's quite possible that you train may not make it up a hill at all!
