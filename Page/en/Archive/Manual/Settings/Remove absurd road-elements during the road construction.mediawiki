{{en/Nightly|This option was added in r11172, on 2007-09-26.}}

Makes the [[en/Manual/Local authority#fund-local-road-construction|local road reconstruction]] programme actually do something.  When this patch is active, after road works are finished in a road tile, unnecessary road pieces are removed.  Unnecessary road pieces are those leading into buildings, water, uncrossable railroads, etc.
