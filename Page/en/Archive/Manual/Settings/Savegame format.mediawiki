[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Savegame format]]
[[Category:en/Manual/Settings & Preferences]]

The save game format to use. This is a client-setting only. This should only be used for testing only, as the best option for your system will be selected by default.

Explanation of values:
* <empty> - Will use the best setting for your system (usually zlib, if support has been compiled in, otherwise none).
* memory - Unknown, does not appear to work.
* lzo - Use lzo compression, does not appear to work.
* zlib - Use zlib compression.
* none - Use no compression.

The loading of save games is unaffected by the choice you have here.
 

'''Valid options:''' [ <empty> | memory | lzo | zlib | none ]
