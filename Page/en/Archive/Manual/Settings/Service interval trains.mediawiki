[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Service interval trains]]
With this feature, you can set the amount of days a train will wait since its last service before it will go to a depot to be serviced again. This can also be set to '''disable''', then you can add go to depot orders allowing you to have better control over when a train is serviced.
