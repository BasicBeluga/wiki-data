====Zoom level boundaries====
{{en/Feature|1.2|float=right|text=(since 1.2.0)}}
Maximum zoom level and minimum zoom level allow you to set the most zoomed-out and most zoomed-in state which the mouse wheel will allow to zoom-in or zoom-out.

The intention is to not need to load all (big) sprites for a certain zoom-in level or not run into a lag on evolved games by preventing to accidentially zoom-out more than usually intended.

:''Possible Settings:''
;Maximum zoom-in
: 4x, 2x, normal
;Maximum zoom-out
: 2x, 4x, 8x

:''In Openttd.cfg config file:'' ([gui] zoom_max, zoom_min)
