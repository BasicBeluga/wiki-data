When enabled, this [[en/Community/Patches/Patches|patch]] makes all signals appear on the same side as is set for [[en/Manual/Vehicles|vehicles]] to drive on.

== Description ==

Normally, signals on train tracks appear on the opposite side of the track to which [[en/Manual/Vehicles|vehicles]] drive on the road, i.e. if you have it set up so that [[en/Manual/Vehicles|vehicles]] drive on the left, any signals would appear on the right of the [[en/Manual/Trains|train]] track.

With this patch enabled, the situation is reversed and signals appear on the "driving side", i.e.  if you have it set up so that [[en/Manual/Vehicles|vehicles]] drive on the left, any signals will also appear on the left of any tracks you may have.
