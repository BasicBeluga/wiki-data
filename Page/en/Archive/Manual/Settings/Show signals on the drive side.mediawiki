[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Show signals on the drive side]]
When enabled, this patch makes all signals appear on the same side as is set for vehicles to drive on, i.e. if you have it set up so that vehicles drive on the left, any signals will also appear on the left of any tracks you may have.  When disabled, signals appear on the opposite side.
