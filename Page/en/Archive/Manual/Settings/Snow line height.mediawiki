[[Translation:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Snow line height]]
This [[en/Community/Patches/Patches|patch]] allows you to determine at what "altitude" snow will appear.  

== Description ==

After a certain height of tile, all tiles are drawn as snow tiles.  In this way, it's possible to have snow-capped mountains etc. without having to play an arctic map.  This patch enables you to adjust the height above which all tiles will become snow tiles.

== Use ==

The number is the height in tiles above which snow will cover the ground.
