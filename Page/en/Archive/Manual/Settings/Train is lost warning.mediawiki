{{en/Outdated|Replacing with new patch info}}


'''This patch has been replaced with (lost_train_warn).'''

'''The information below is obsolete!'''


A [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|setting]] that helps you managing trains by reporting vehicle as '''lost''' if the station it is currently heading to has not been reached in this amount of time.

== Description ==

When a train has not arrived at station for a set amount of time, the message will appear.
You can click on the message to center main screen over the train in order to fix the problem.
<center>[[File:en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Losttrain.png|center|frame|Train 1 has not arrived at station for a long time]]</center>
<br>
Trains get lost because
<ul>
<li>there is a traffic jam on a junction</li>
<li>a signal is placed at the wrong side</li>
<li>[[en/Manual/Disasters|piece of track has been destroyed]]</li>
<li>station is not connected to railway track with train on</li>
</ul>
<br>
When using large maps, this message can also appear if you have a line running from one end of the map to the other, especially in early years when trains are still (relatively) slow.
<br>

== Use ==
