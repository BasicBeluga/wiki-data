In [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/OpenTTD 0.5.0]], Unicode has been introduced. This allows for support for languages which use non-ASCII characters, like Chinese or Russian.

It is also possible to use different fonts in OpenTTD using this feature using three strings in your openttd.cfg under misc:

<pre>small_font =
medium_font =
large_font =</pre>

Small fonts are used beneath vehicles in the vehicle lists, as the date on newspapers, and other places.
Medium fonts is the majority of GUI text, town and station names, and window headers.
Large Fonts are used as newspaper headings and on the endgame Score list.

Fill these out with fonts installed on your system and they will be displayed in the game.

Be aware that most fonts make a poor small font, while other fonts may not make good medium or large sizes.
