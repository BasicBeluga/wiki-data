Shade Windows is a new feature in trunk since r18588. It allows you to shade windows (as the name says) so that they don't take up as much space as they normally do.
See the following pictures...

In the above image the train list is untouched, the only difference being the new shade windows button.

==Development==
Shade Windows was based off of the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=43595 patch by erikjanp]. Because of the many GUI changes in trunk, the patch behaves somewhat differently in trunk than using the patch. For example, in erikjanp's original patch, when the window was shaded, the width stay the same. In trunk, the width is shortened to contain the string/text within it.
