Also known as the new map generator, Terra Geneses creates random maps that look more "real world" than the old generator. See also [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=23434 TerraGenesis Perlin]. Currently, it is being tested in a dedicated release, but it can also be found in [[en/Archive/Community/Mini Integrated Nightly]].
