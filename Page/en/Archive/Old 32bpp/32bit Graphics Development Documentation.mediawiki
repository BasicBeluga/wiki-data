==Joining New Graphics Development==

We are in need of '''artists''', '''Administrators''' (to do manual tasks such as keep the wiki organised), '''Coders''' (to help us code features to enable new GFX options)...

For helping with the '''New GFX development''', you will need to learn how to model in 3d (unless you are helping with some of the 2d tasks) , we suggest the Open Source 3d package "Blender" available from http://blender.org .

You can contact Ben if you want to help, alternatively you can go to the OTTD GFX forum at http://tt-forums.net and can talk to people there. The GFX forum is [http://tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=36].

[[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Wiki colours (New graphics)|Wiki colours]] - Easy reference for people editing the wiki.

==Template File and Specifications==
* '''Blender''': Download [http://www.tt-forums.net/download.php?id=53231 Version F] (new contrast version)  '''Please read through at least the warning sections below.'''
* Ben made a '''3d Studio Max''' Template and  Aracirion made a '''Lightwave''' Template. You can pm them for details.

This file contains correct lighting, camera position, resolution etc. 1 Blender Unit equals 1 metre. There are templates for different sizes of buildings. If you need more sizes, or if anything is not clear or you want to say something else please join the discussion in this thread: [[http://tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=24857&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=100 forum thread]].

===Sizes===

{{en/Note|This section is under discussion, due to the latest developments for 32bpp graphics}}

In maximum zoom level one square of 12,5 x 12,5 m will be 256px across:
[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Model square.png|center|frame|One square at maximum zoom level]]
This will also be the basic unit for railway tracks and roads. As the buildings in the original ttd look as if they are about 25x25m per square, many new buildings will occupy 2x2 new 12,5m squares. For Scale comparison Ben Robbins modelled Ottis, a real-size human: [http://tt-forums.net/download.php?id=48953].
[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/3dsmeasurements.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|The sizes for a single square building.]]

If you work with 3D Studio Max, you have a semi-transparent square grid on the ground in the Perspective viewport. It is 140x140 units big on its default settings. Using these measurements, if we assume this ground raster to represent one Transport Tycoon square, we can assume that a human being of two meters tall would take up 22,4 units. Use this to scale your building, prop or vehicle.
If you create a 2x2 building, just divide the appropriate figures by 2.
This way, when all buildings will come together, one large building will not look like a miniature when compared to a supposedly small building.
If you want the home grid to have a different size, go to Customize, and in the Grid and Snap Settings dialogue, go to Home Grid tab.

===Materials===
Alltaken-edit:  why?  Amb and Ref are totally different, Amb is only effected by the "ambient colour" set in the world settings, of which i don't believe we have an ambient colour set. (or do we?)

I think its safe to remove this red-section in the wiki.  whoever wrote it please contact me.

{{en/Warning|for EVERY material you create, in the 'shaders' tab (see image), you have to change the 'Amb' parameter (it's 0.5 by default) to match the 'Ref' parameter (it's 1 by default). Then you always have to modify 'Ref' and 'Amb' together. 'Amb' should always have the same value as 'Ref'.

====Official Materials====
[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Official materials.png|center|frame|The official_materials]]
The template file archive contains a file named ''official_materials.blend''. It contains some materials which you will need often, and which should look the same in different objects, like for example pavement. Put this file in a location where it can stay. Then, when you have built a model and want to use an official material, link it rather than just appending. For instructions how, see [[en/Using Official Materials]].
{{en/Warning|Make sure you link to the official materials rather than just appending them. The advantage will be that once we change how the pavement looks, for example, you just have to replace the ''official_materials.blend'', and the material will be updated in all your files automatically.
}}

====Custom Materials and Props====

[[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Standardised materials (New Graphics)|Textures]] - For now, this page contains some image maps. Eventually, it should contain "blender" materials.

[[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Props (New Graphics)|Props]] - This page contains props like trees and cars.

====External Free Image Libraries====
[http://www.cgtextures.com/] CgTextures.com

===Render Time===
Rendering can be quite slow. To reduce time it takes to render for previews, reduce the Ambient Occlusion 'Samples' value:

===Sprites===
[[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Ground Sprites Automated (New Graphics)|Ground Sprites Automated]] - A tutorial showing GFX artists how to create a set of 85+ ground sprites in about 30 mins.  includes many automated files.

[[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Ground sprites conversions list (New Graphics)|Ground Sprite conversion list]] - This list will be helpful for those wishing to use the automated sprites in the old or new GFX format.

[[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Tile version table (New graphics)|Tile version table]] A table showing the required/desired versions of each object

[[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Rendered Angles table (New graphics)|Rendered Angles table]] - This page has tables containing the angles of renders in relation to their render number, useful for coders.

[[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Tile Test Tool]] - A useful tool for testing out new tiles.
