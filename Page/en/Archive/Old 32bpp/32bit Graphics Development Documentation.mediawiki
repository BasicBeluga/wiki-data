'''How to use the 32 bpp graphics'''

*Have OpenTTD SVN revision 11119 or higher installed (make sure you know which folder it is in). You can download it from [http://www.openttd.org/nightly.php nightlies]
*Grab a 32bpp graphics tar file, e.g. from this [[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/List of downloadable 32 bpp tars | list]].
*Go to the folder where OpenTTD is installed.
*Go to the data folder (this is the one where you put your NewGRFs by default).
*Put the 32bpp graphics tar file in this folder.  

Now you have 32bpp sprites installed, but you have to tell the OpenTTD to use the 32bpp blitter (sprite drawing engine) in order to be able to use them. 
    
The easiest way to do this:
*Go to the folder where OpenTTD is installed.
*Open the file openttd.cfg with a text editor.
*Search for the [misc] section.
*Add one of the following lines in this section: 
**blitter = 32bpp-simple        (slower but reliable)      
**blitter = 32bpp-optimized  (faster) 
**blitter = 32bpp-anim       (with animation)
*Save the file.
*Start OpenTTD the way you're used to.

Alternatively you can start OpenTTD with <code>-b 32bpp-simple</code> or <code>-b 32bpp-anim</code> or <code>-b 32bpp-optimized</code> parameter.
Available blitters can be found by starting OpenTTD with the -h option.

To specify the blitter in Windows XP you can use the commandline, or: 

*Find a shortcut which you are using to start OpenTTD and make a copy of it OR go to OpenTTD directory and create a shortcut to the file '''openttd.exe'''.
*Right click on newly created shortcut and choose 'Properties' menu item (should be the bottommost item in the menu).
*Go to middle tab ('Shortcut') and look for a field called 'Destination' (or something similar, it will be the first editable field in this tab).
*Add <code>-b 32bpp-anim</code> to the end of the field.

Example: In case this field's content was:

 "C:\Documents and Settings\Mchl\My Documents\prv\openttd\openttd.exe"

Change it to:
 "C:\Documents and Settings\Mchl\My Documents\prv\openttd\openttd.exe" -b 32bpp-anim

*Accept the changes and basically you're done. You can now rename your shortcut to something like OpenTTD32bpp or whatever. And of course double click it to play in 32bpp.

In Linux and other UNIXes:

 ./openttd -b 32bpp-anim

==Joining New Graphics Development==

We are in need of '''artists''', '''administrators''' (to do manual tasks such as keep the documentation organised), '''coders''' (to help us code features to enable new GFX options)...

For helping with the '''New GFX development''', you will need to learn how to model in 3D (unless you are helping with some of the 2D tasks), we suggest the Open Source 3d package ''Blender'' available from http://blender.org.

You can contact Ben if you want to help, alternatively you can go to the OTTD GFX forum at http://tt-forums.net and can talk to people there. The GFX forum is [http://tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=36].

[[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Wiki colours (New graphics)|Wiki colours]] - Easy reference for people editing the documentation.

==Template File and Specifications==
* '''Blender''': Download [http://www.tt-forums.net/download.php?id=53231 Version F] (new contrast version)  '''Please read through at least the warning sections below.'''
* Ben made a '''3d Studio Max''' Template [http://www.tt-forums.net/download.php?id=81166|1] and  Aracirion made a '''Lightwave''' Template. You can pm them for details.

This file contains correct lighting, camera position, resolution etc. 1 Blender Unit equals 1 metre. There are templates for different sizes of buildings. If you need more sizes, or if anything is not clear or you want to say something else please join the discussion in this thread: [[http://tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=24857&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=100 forum thread]].

===Sizes===

{{en/Note|This section is under discussion, due to the latest developments for 32bpp graphics}}

In maximum zoom level one square of 12,5 x 12,5 m will be 64px across:
[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Model square.png|center|frame|One square at maximum zoom level]]
This will also be the basic unit for railway tracks and roads. As the buildings in the original ttd look as if they are about 25x25m per square, many new buildings will occupy 2x2 new 12,5m squares. For Scale comparison Ben Robbins modelled Ottis, a real-size human: [http://tt-forums.net/download.php?id=48953].
[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/3dsmeasurements.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|The sizes for a single square building.]]

If you work with 3D Studio Max, you have a semi-transparent square grid on the ground in the Perspective viewport. It is 140x140 units big on its default settings. Using these measurements, if we assume this ground raster to represent one Transport Tycoon square, we can assume that a human being of two meters tall would take up 22,4 units. Use this to scale your building, prop or vehicle.
If you create a 2x2 building, just divide the appropriate figures by 2.
This way, when all buildings will come together, one large building will not look like a miniature when compared to a supposedly small building.
If you want the home grid to have a different size, go to Customize, and in the Grid and Snap Settings dialogue, go to Home Grid tab.

===Materials===

For EVERY material you create, in the 'shaders' tab (see image), you are advised to change the 'Amb' parameter (it's 0.5 by default) to match the 'Ref' parameter (it's 1 by default). Then you always have to modify 'Ref' and 'Amb' together. 'Amb' should always have the same value as 'Ref'. The  explanation for this advise: material does reflect the light from the sun or other light-sources the same way it reflects light from the environment (ambient). So for maximum realism, the values should be the same. This is not a strict rule, of course you do have your 'artistic freedom' to deviate from this. {{en/-}}
[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Ref-&-amb.png|600px]]

====Official Materials====
[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Official materials.png|center|frame|The official materials]]
The template file archive contains a file named ''official_materials.blend''. It contains some materials which you will need often, and which should look the same in different objects, like for example pavement. Put this file in a location where it can stay. Then, when you have built a model and want to use an official material, link it rather than just appending. For instructions how, see [[en/Using Official Materials]].
{{en/Warning|Make sure you link to the official materials rather than just appending them. The advantage will be that once we change how the pavement looks, for example, you just have to replace the ''official_materials.blend'', and the material will be updated in all your files automatically.
}}

====Custom Materials and Props====

[[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Standardised materials (New Graphics)|Textures]] - For now, this page contains some image maps. Eventually, it should contain "blender" materials.

[[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Props (New Graphics)|Props]] - This page contains props like trees and cars.

====External Free Image Libraries====

===Render Time===
Rendering can be quite slow. To reduce time it takes to render for previews, reduce the Ambient Occlusion 'Samples' value:
