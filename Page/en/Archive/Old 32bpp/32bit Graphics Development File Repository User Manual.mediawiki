[[Translation:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/32bit Graphics Development File Repository User Manual]]
Early March 2009 saw the release of a [http://jupix.info/openttd/gfxdev-repo/ public file repository] for the [[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/32bit Graphics Development]] effort. The repo was written and is hosted and administered by Jupix. He takes suggestions and advice at [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=42293 tt-forums].

==What is it and what should I upload?==

It began as a simple file hosting tool that took in uploads and printed lists of files for users. Since then more features have been implemented and it currently supports:

* adding, editing and removing file entries, obviously
* categorization of entries
* searching by one or more keywords or a phrase
* forking entries into derivative works

The repository is intended to be used by 32bit graphics developers. The point is to have a single place for all development files for the entire project, based on the principle that sooner or later, all artists grow disinterested, and unless their work files can be found in a repository like this, they can never be properly improved again.

In other words, if you are an artist, you should upload absolutely everything that has to do with your works... Textures, models, sprites, plans, readme files, everything. And all versions, too. Works just started or in progress, testing releases and finals. The more content, the better for the project - if someone wants to change something, they suddely can! That's the spirit of an open game.

All bundles should be broken down into individual models and packaged to contain all files pertaining to that individual model. This rule of thumb is based on the assumption that the target audience of the repository are developers looking to either change something in a model, or run pngcodec on a model. Therefore the more models in a bundle, the more downloading has to occur over a slow WAN connection, and the harder it is to find just the right .blend in a .zip.

Big bundles aimed at players are intended to go elsewhere, hopefully the game's internal content delivery system.

All final releases should include both extra and normal zoom sprites.

==Authentication required==

The repository requires authentication for all actions, including read actions. We use the '''guest:guest''' login for those. Write actions require individual registration. (If you sign up for read/write access, you can obviously use your account for browsing.)

In registering, please use the username you use at the forums. Password can, and should, be different.

Because write access to a server over HTTP is serious business, the repository features a robust system for verifying the user attempting to register has an active account at tt-forums. The way it works is, it basically tries to post a PM to yourself, containing a link back to the registration script with a unique activation key. '''For you to get through registration, you need to have an active cookie at the forums, so before registering, make sure you have logged in at tt-forums with the "always log me in" tickbox checked.'''

For a step-by-step tutorial on registering, read on.

==Edit mode==

Because most of the time you will be checking for recent activity at the repository, and want as little clutter in the interface as possible, all write actions are hidden in the GUI until you enable what's called "edit mode".

When enabled, you get form fields to edit everything you have clearance to. All write actions are stuff that is done in edit mode: adding files, editing notes, ownership changes, and so on.

For a step-by-step tutorial in how the above stuff is done, read on.

==Version numbering==

It's pretty pointless to tack on "0.9" or "2.1" or such to our stuff, isn't it. We never know when our graphics are "1.0". Still, we need some sort of version numbering to keep tabs on whether we are looking at the latest content. Therefore the repo uses a simple integer, starting from one, and automatically increments that each time a file is revised. So versions will go 1, 2, 3, and so on as content is updated.

===Registering===

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-register-1.png]]

Enter the repository and click '''register an account'''.

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-register-2.png]]

Enter your desired credentials. Note that it is recommended you use your ''tt-forums'' user account name, with a different password.

At this step, you should open a new browser tab and navigate to tt-forums. Once there, log out and log in, making sure you have '''Log me on automatically each visit''' ticked:

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-register-6.jpeg]]

Once done, click register.

At the next step, read the instructions on your screen, they are important. Click "go to tt-forums".

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-register-3.jpeg]]

Now at tt-forums, click "preview" to get a clickable activation link, or "send" to save the message in your inbox for nostalgia. 

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-register-4.png]]

Either way, you now have a clickable link. Click it.

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-register-5.png]]

You can now log in using this form.

===Adding files===

First, you need a read/write account, so you need to register - see above. Once you have - log in.

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-addfile-1.png]]

Enable editing mode using the circled link. Navigate to your category of choice.

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-addfile-2.png]]

The file upload form is at the bottom of the category view. Fill it and submit, and you're done.

Some further notes on adding files: sprites or .blends, whatever the upload, it needs to be either a .zip or a .tar. Screenshots need to be .png or .jpg. Screenshots are GOOD! Please use the feature and upload screenshots.

Also, make good use of the "notes" field. Any and all information on licensing, recent developments, basically all that has been going on at the forums about this particular file, needs to go here. After all, the repository is for ridding ourselves of the need to search the forums for information on stuff related to graphics development.

===Managing your files===

The file view in edit mode, image below, has four basic controls for managing files. To see them on a file, you need to be the designated owner. We'll denote different features with colors.

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Repo-fileview.png]]

The red form allows you to re-title a file. This will not rename the physical file.

The yellow form allows you to remove a file completely from the server. '''There is no confirmation window.''' The activity history of the file will be preserved.

The green form allows you to transfer all ownership of this file onto any other user account with read/write clearance. You will be stripped of ownership.

The blue form allows you to update the notes and/or screenshot on a file, neither of which will increment the version number of a file entry. It also allows you to revise a file (upload a new version). Doing this will increment the version number by one.
