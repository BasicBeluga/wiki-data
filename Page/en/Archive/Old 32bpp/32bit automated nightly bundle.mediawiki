[[Translation:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/32bit automated nightly bundle]]
The [http://jupix.info/openttd/gfxdev-nightlies/ 32bit automated nightly bundle compiler] is a script, run daily, that takes certain kinds of graphics from the [[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/32bit Graphics Development File Repository]] and bundles them into a tar that can be used by players as a graphics set.

==Requirements for inclusion==

Specifically, it takes graphics that meet the following requirements:

* Type is set to "all zooms sprites".
* Status is set to "released".

Sprites that would go under "32bpp-extra" are not included, and should be downloaded off the 32bpp-extra project page.

There is a black list in effect - repository entries added on this list are mostly duplicates or the like.

Sprites need to be archived in the tar in the usual way (using one of the game-compatible directory structures). The script will understand the dir tree and organise the sprites accordingly. If you have bundled sources (.blends, textures, photos or whatever) or user information within your tar, don't worry, this script will ignore them and will only organise and bundle png's.

==Functionality==

The script will sort the sprites into the [[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/32bit standard tar format]]. This includes symlinks & all which should make the pack playable on any base set. The pack should also be playable without an -EZ binary but obviously you need -EZ for the closer zoom levels.
