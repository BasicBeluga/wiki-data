There is a not official branch (address below) where Egladil is converting the code to handle 32 bit per pixel graphics, which I needed for the [[en/Archive/Community/Graphics Replacement]]. The goal is not to see the final work been merged with the trunk, but rather to see what can be done in this direction. If ever it has to be merged, it will be a reward, but not the final motivation.
