Answers to frequently asked questions and problems with 32 bit graphics in OpenTTD.

===I upgraded to 1.2.x, why do the 32 bit graphics not work any more?===

The method of providing 32 bit graphics to the game has changed from png graphics inside tar files to [[en/Manual/NewGRF]]. The ability to load 32 bit graphics from png/tar files is not available in OpenTTD 1.2.0 and newer.

===Where can I find NewGRFs with 32 bit graphics for download?===

See the [[en/Community/NewGRF/Playing with 32 bpp graphics]].

===I used to have many more 32 bit graphics before OpenTTD 1.2.0, where are they?===

Many 32 bit graphics have not yet been converted from the old format to NewGRFs. This process takes time and is frustrated by license issues. Feel free to [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=36 help out], sorting out the license stuff and converting the remaining GPL licensed graphics to NewGRF format.

If you want to keep all 32 bit graphics you had previously (including the ones with unclear or restictive licenses), you'll have to do the conversion yourself. knuckles88 has posted [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=1026754#p1026754 instructions] on how to do that.
