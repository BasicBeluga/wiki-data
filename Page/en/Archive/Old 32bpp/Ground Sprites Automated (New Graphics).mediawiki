[[Translation:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Ground Sprites Automated (New Graphics)]]
This page documents the process artists must go through to create a set of ground sprites.
The Page should link to a number of Automated files.

== Step One ==
'''Downloading and understanding the files you will need.'''
[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Files.png|left|frame|1. example file structure]] <br> The important files and folders that must be kept are '''Outlines, Outlines2, *.Blend,''' and if on windows with photoshop '''Black-AlphaZero.exe'''<br>
<br style="clear: left"/>

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Outlines.png|left|frame|2. Outlines]]
[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Outlines2.png|left|frame|3. Outlines2]]<br>
Outlines the folder contains overlays used by blender to cut the renders, thus making the testilate fully. Outlines would be used for flat standard ground tiles.<br>
Outlines2 the folder contains overlays which just cut the bottom off, this lets things such a fields, shrubs, rocks etc... stick aobve the top of the sprite. for correct visual display both overlays may need to be used. (ask me "Alltaken" if that is the case)

'''Below are uneeded (example) folders'''

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Field1.png|left|frame|2.fields]]
[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Field2.png|left|frame|3. fields2]]<br>
Fields one and Fields2 are optional folders (i created them as output folders for rendered ground sprites) these particular images used the outlines2 overlays to allow for the crops to go above the top of the sprite.
<br style="clear: left"/>

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Grass.png|left|frame|2.Grass]]<br>
Grass is the name of the folder i created to store my rendered "standard" grass tiles. (i.e. not with shores, not with rocks on them.....)  this could be named anything you like. i.e. you could name it desert, snow....
<br style="clear: left"/>

[[File:en/Archive/Old 32bpp/Shore.png|left|frame|2.Shore]]<br>
the Shore folders, are fairly important, these are also part of the "Grass set" but are Shore tiles for it.  you could call the shore folders anything you like, but i adopted Shore-Shore3 refering to the water level and how far up the tile the water was ((for underwater sprites)
<br style="clear: left"/>

'''Black-Alphazero.exe''' is a droplet created for PS7 in windows, it functions as a method to remove the Black from rendered sprites and make it alpha (allowing testelation and correct overlaying) this needs to be done since blender outputs sprites with the Black overlays from outlines/outlines2.

'''Ground*.Blend''' (currently Ground2.blend version numbers will increase as the file is improved) this is the .Blend file that you will create your GFX in and render from, this handles most automation of things, and will make your job very quick if you use it correctly

== Step Two ==
'''Editing the texture settings'''

== Step Three ==
'''Rendering your images'''

== Step Four ==
'''Cutting your images out'''

== Step Five ==
'''Using photoshop or GIMP to apply alpha'''

== Step Six ==
'''Cropping sprites and packing Sprites for game use.'''
