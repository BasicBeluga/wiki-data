''There used to be a list of downloadable 32bit graphics here. It was a remnant from times when that was the most convenient way to deliver finished graphics. At the time of writing this note, the most convenient player resource is the [[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/32bit automated nightly bundle]]. For some individual tars, go to [[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/32bpp Extra Zoom Levels Files]].''
