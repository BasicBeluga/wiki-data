The new grafix will bring more realistic airplanes, whose sizes have been discussed before. I would like to propose making them (at least as an option) realistically sized, for the following reasons:
* now airplanes are far too easy. airports are far more convenient to place than train stations, so large airports would make it a bit more difficult again. It would also make airplanes less suited for the short distances.
* it would look cool. Look at some cities in googel earth: airports ''are'' huge

=Construction / Ownership=
* It might be possible to have airports constructed/owned by cities and individual parking spaces rented out to companies. Having totally modular airports is technically difficult, but a format allowing for a variable number of parking spaces being built to a single runway would make enhancing airport capacity easier. A large airport could have several terminals owned by different players, for example. ([http://tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=27724&start=9 forum])
* There should be a height-limit for buildings being built directly in front of the runway, so that planes don't fly "through" buildings. (Saving the height of buildings with the sprite might also be necessary for building bridges over buildings ...)

=unsolved problems=
* advantage for newer airplanes: now, the Dc-8 and B-777 remain top-planes until late in the game because of their speed. there mus be ''something'' making an A-310 (e.g.) superior to them, or why would you want to buy a new plane?
* '''breakdown''' handling is silly now. 
:* if anything, it should force the plane to go to the nearest airport, plus make it more likely that the plane crashes, (especially if no airport at hand).  planes with 4 engines should get an advantage, there. (The A340 has 4 engines because of the "ETOPS problem: two-engined aircraft had to stay within close range of emergency airfields in case one of their engines malfunctioned. ... The four-engined A340 is able to fly long over-water routes." ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A340 wikipedia A340]))

=Size=
Here is a table with some of the more popular planes' wingspan. Judging from that table, I could imagine the following airports:
* old small airport: 3 tiles wide
* city airport: 4 tiles
* international: 6 tiles
(maybe the A-380 could be squeezed into 6 tiles .......)
