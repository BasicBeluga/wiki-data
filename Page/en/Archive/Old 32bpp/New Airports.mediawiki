The new grafix will bring more realistic airplanes, whose sizes have been discussed before. I would like to propose making them (at least as an option) realistically sized, for the following reasons:
* now airplanes are far too easy. airports are far more convenient to place than train stations, so large airports would make it a bit more difficult again. It would also make airplanes less suited for the short distances.
* it would look cool. Look at some cities in googel earth: airports ''are'' huge

=Construction / Ownership=
It might be possible to have airports owned by cities and individual parking spaces rented out to companies. Having totally modular airports is technically difficult, but a format allowing for a variable number of parking spaces being built to a single runway would make enhancing airport capacity easier ([http://tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=27724&start=9 forum]).

=Size=
Here is a table with some of the more popular planes' wingspan. Judging from that table, I could imagine the following airports:
* old small airport: 3 tiles wide
* city airport: 4 tiles
* international: 6 tiles
(maybe the A-380 could be squeezed into 6 tiles .......)
