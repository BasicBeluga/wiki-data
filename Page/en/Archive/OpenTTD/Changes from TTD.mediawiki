OpenTTD is modelled after the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe game by Chris Sawyer and enhances the game experience dramatically. Many features were inspired by TTDPatch while others are original. 

==What's in OpenTTD that wasn't in the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe?==

Significant enhancements

* Autorail build tool - Lets you drag and drop in any direction and the computer will build the tracks in that direction for you.
* Canals/shiplifts - Allowing players to create waterways which stretch over the land and have ships navigate them.
* Larger stations - Stations can be longer, consisting of many more platforms.
* Non-uniform stations - Stations can be build slightly offset.
* Ability to join stations (of same width or length) - Building a station next to another station of the same type, width and lengths creates a single longer station.
* Checkpoints - A special piece of track which can be placed on branching routes to force a train to use a particular branch to reach it's destination.
* Mammoth trains - Trains can be much longer.
* Multi-headed trains - Trains can have more than one engine to help increase the speed when carrying heavy loads, power up hills etc.
* Build on slopes and coasts - It's possible to build on the slopes of the coastline or hills; the revelant tile is filled to a flat height for a certain cost.
* Goto depot order - Allows insertion of an order instructing a vehicle to return to the depot.
* Longer bridges - Bridges can span greater distances... at a price.
* Higher bridges - Bridges can span over greater heights enabling more complex networks.
* Two new bridges - To enable greater use of the higher speed trains.
* Presignals (CTRL-click on existing signals) - As TTDPatch.
* Semaphores (CTRL-D to place them) - As TTDPatch.
* Order sharing and copying ("goto" on other vehicle to copy, ctrl+"goto" to share) - Vehicles can now share orders with order changes propogating to all vehicles, and orders can just be copied by clicking on any other vehicle to save time.
* TTDpatch compatible Nonstop-handling - Exactly as it says on the tin.
* Crossing tunnels - Tunnels may now cross over each other underground.
* Build many trees on one tile
* Bribe the town authority - If your townsmen hate you, you can bribe the local authority to help you but it's expensive and runs the risk of you being caught.
