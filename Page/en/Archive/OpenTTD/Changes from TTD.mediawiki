=What's in OpenTTD that wasn't in the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe?=

OpenTTD is modelled after the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe game by Chris Sawyer and enhances the game experience dramatically. Many features were inspired by TTDPatch while others are original. 

==Significant enhancements==

* Multiple ports - A native Linux version, Windows, Mac OS X and more
* Autorail build tool - Lets you drag and drop in any direction and the computer will build the tracks in that direction for you.
* [[en/Manual/Water Transport Tiles]]/shiplifts - Allowing players to create waterways which stretch over the land and have ships navigate them.
* Larger stations - Stations can be longer, consisting of many more platforms.
* [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Nonuniform stations|Non-uniform stations]] - Stations can be build slightly offset.
* Ability to [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Join train stations|join stations]] (of same width or length) - Building a station next to another station of the same type, width and lengths creates a single longer station.
* [[en/Manual/Waypoints]] - A special piece of track which can be placed on branching routes to force a train to use a particular branch to reach it's destination.
* [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Mammoth trains|Mammoth trains]] - Trains can be much longer.
* Multi-headed trains - Trains can have more than one engine to help increase the speed when carrying heavy loads, power up hills etc.
* [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|Build on slopes]] and coasts - It's possible to build on the slopes of the coastline or hills; the revelant tile is filled to a flat height for a certain cost.
* Goto depot order - Allows insertion of an order instructing a vehicle to return to the depot.
* [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Longer bridges|Longer bridges]] - Bridges can span greater distances... at a price.
* Higher bridges - Bridges can span over greater heights enabling more complex networks.
* Two new [[en/Manual/Bridges|bridges]] - To enable greater use of the higher speed trains.
* Presignals (CTRL-click on existing signals) - As TTDPatch.
* Semaphores (CTRL-D to place them) - As TTDPatch.
* [[en/Manual/Orders|Order sharing]] and [[en/Manual/Orders|copying]] ("goto" on other vehicle to copy, ctrl+"goto" to share) - Vehicles can now share orders with order changes propogating to all vehicles, and orders can just be copied by clicking on any other vehicle to save time.
* TTDpatch compatible Nonstop-handling - Exactly as it says on the tin.
* [[en/Archive/Manual/Crossing tunnels|Crossing tunnels]] - Tunnels may now cross over each other underground.
* Build many trees on one tile
* [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Bribe authority|Bribe the town authority]] - If your townsmen hate you, you can bribe the local authority to help you but it's expensive and runs the risk of you being caught.
* Much improved [[en/Manual/Multiplayer|networking and internet play]] by TCP/IP, including server lists, kick/ban, dedicated server and chat.
* A new AI (currently in progress)
* All TTDLX savegames are supported (.SS1, .SV1, .SV2, .SV0, .SS0). 
* Two new types of airport ([[en/Manual/Airports|metropolitan]] in 1980 and [[en/Manual/Airports|international]] in 1990)

==Better usability==

* [[en/Manual/Convert rail|Convert rail]] tool (to rail, monorail, maglev) - To enable you to easily switch your tracks to the latest technology.
* Build stations with drag & drop - Rather than guess at the size or count the tiles, just drag and drop the station over the desired area and it is built for you.
* [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build in pause|Build while paused]] - An optional patch that allows building while the game is paused.
* Mouse wheel can be used to scroll in menus and to zoom in/out on win32
* Autoscroll (to left/right) - when you reach the edge of the screen, it moves across.
* Bigger demolish tool
* Plant trees on area
* [[en/Manual/Sell entire train|Sell whole train]] by dragging to dynamite trashcan - Sells the whole train instead of just a single carriage.
* Cost estimation with Shift - Holding Shift on almost any action will show you how much it will cost you before you do it.
* Road and rail removing by dragging
* Company HQ can now be moved somewhere else (cost 1% of company value)
