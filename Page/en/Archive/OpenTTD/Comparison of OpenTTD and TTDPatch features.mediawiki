[[Translation:en/Archive/OpenTTD/Comparison of OpenTTD and TTDPatch features]]
'''Here you have a small comparative between OpenTTD and TTDPatch Features'''

If you are a regular '''TTDPatch user''', you will notice that many similar things are implemented differently in OpenTTD. Not all features are [[en/Manual/Interoperability|compatible]] with [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]].
