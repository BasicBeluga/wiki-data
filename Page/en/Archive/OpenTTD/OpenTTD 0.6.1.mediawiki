0.6.1-RC1 (2008-04-26) [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=37339 forum link]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fix: Vehicle groups, engine replacement rules and player/company names were not properly reset/freed after bankrupt (r12906)
* Fix: Remove trams from savegames saved in OTTD without tram support, it is better than to simply crash [FS#1953] (r12904)
* Fix: GCC on FreeBSD does not support -dumpmachine causing configure to fail. Use g++ instead [FS#1928] (r12876)
* Fix: Make the town rating tests use less memory and much quicker (r12859)
* Fix: Usage of AutoPtr made (trying to) build stuff very (time) expensive (r12857, r12855)
* Fix: Ensure that prop 25 is set for all vehicles in the consist before other properties as it could cause desyncs (r12856)
* Fix: Too much catenary was drawn about tunnel entrances, middle bridge pieces and non-rail station tiles (r12853, r12852)
* Fix: Use YAPF for fairly old savegames from before YAPF was introduced (r12845)
* Fix: The industry tick trigger should only be triggered once every 256 ticks, not every tick... Also bail out of the triggers a little earlier if you know they are not going to happen anyway (r12844)
* Fix: Inconsistent use of 8/15-bitness of NewGRF callback results with respect to TTDP's implementation of the specification (r12819, r12818, r12759)
* Fix: Possible out of bounds array access (r12809)
* Fix: Enforce autorenew values range in command (r12808)
* Fix: Vehicles could break down during loading and keep loading. The intention of the break down code is not to break down when having zero speed, therefor break downs now do not happen when loading [FS#1938] (r12795)
* Fix: [OSX] In some rare cases when using an uncalibrated monitor the system colour space could not be retrieved. Show an error when this happens instead of just trying an assertion (r12776)
* Fix: Slope checking for NewGRFs failed (r12759)
* Fix: Check the TILE_NOT_SLOPED flag of the _north_ tile of multi-tile houses to decide if autoslope is allowed (r12717)
* Fix: Do not move windows below the toolbar on resizes unless they would go behind the toolbar [FS#1904] (r12714)
* Fix: Increase default sound buffer size only for Vista [FS#1914] (r12708)
* Fix: Do not crash very hard on unrecognised savegames, just go back to the intro menu instead (r12707)
* Fix: In some cases a news messages would not be shown [FS#1906] (r12683)
* Fix: Removing road pieces from a town gave you twice the intended penalty [FS#1920] (r12682)
* Fix: When a road vehicle has a tram only stop multiple times in a row in it's orders, only the first one would be skipped [FS#1918] (r12678)
* Fix: Colour remaps on station sprites only worked for company colours [FS#1902] (r12674)
* Fix: Remove buggy buoys at tile 0 from old TTDP savegames (r12642)
* Fix: Possible NULL pointer dereference when reading some NewGRF data [FS#1913] (r12637)
* Fix: Infinite loop in case your compiler decides that enums are unsigned by default (r12622)
* Fix: The convert signal button disallowed signal dragging when the signal GUI was closed (r12577)
* Fix: Binding to a specific IP could cause OpenTTD to not register properly with the masterserver if one has multiple external interfaces (r12574)
* Fix: min() has 32bit arguments, clamping of 64bit values did not work (r12572)
* Fix: Towns could not terraform when inflation rised terraform prices enough (r12564)
* Fix: Do not affect town rating change by the order in which we examine stations (r12561)
* Fix: Redraw the signal GUI when the signal drag density changes in the patch settings and vice versa (r12553)
* Fix: Do not install scenarios into the current user's homedir when running 'make install', that is silly. Simply always install scenarios system wide instead (r12542)
