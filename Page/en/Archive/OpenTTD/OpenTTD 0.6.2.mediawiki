[http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=38471 forum link]
* Fix: Possible buffer overflow in string truncation code (r13700)
* Fix: Handle SETX(Y) properly when truncating a string instead of ignoring it and returning a too long string (r13699)
* Fix: In some cases the (sound) mixer could overflow causing artefacts in the sound [FS#2120] (r13695)
* Fix: Do not rely on .tar files always ending with a block of zeros (r13693)
* Fix: Make sure a command is ran in the context of autoreplace or not (r13691)
* Fix: In the case that elrails and 'realistic' acceleration are disabled all electrified engines would have no power on load, until the vehicle got turned around, loaded or got into a depot [FS#2102]
* Fix: Saving TTD imported games in recession failed due to wrong (and unneeded) type conversions in the saveload code [FS#2131] (r13679)
* Fix: Inactive companies from old (TTD) saves could be marked active in some cases, which then loads garbage in their statistics and such [FS#2126] (r13676)
* Fix: Memory leak when NewGRFs got forcefully disabled and they defined GOTO labels (r13675)
* Fix: Crash when drawing a non-real sprite caused by NewGRF interference [FS#2127] (r13674)
* Fix: Desync when building electrified trains on a dedicated server that was started with electrification disabled [FS#2122] (r13673)
* Fix: Bus/truck forgetting go-to-depot order when entering a non-drivethrough road stop [FS#2117] (r13664)
* Fix: Server crashing when banning the rconning client (r13661)
* Fix: Signals were not updated correctly when a player removed a non-existing track piece (r13626)
* Fix: Crash when one tries to raise the nothern corner of MP_VOID tiles (i.e. the southern corner of the tiles on the southern map edge) in the scenario editor [FS#2106] (r13624)
* Fix: Only the front of a RV would be considered when determining to what cargos a vehicle can be refitted instead of all cargos [FS#2109] (r13622)
* Fix: If the first bridge can not be build for a given length, then none of the other bridges can. Effectively meaning that if someone replaces the first bridge with a bridge that be only 3 tiles longs then only other bridges that can be 3 tiles long will be buildable, but only if they are 3 tiles long [FS#2100] (r13611)
* Fix: Signal states could be propagated through waypoints built in orthogonal axis (r13589)
* Fix: [OSX] 10.5 failed to switch to fullscreen (r13584)
* Fix: RVs continueing onto next DT station when they are build adjacent to them [FS#2040] (r13581)
* Fix: Disable static NewGRFs when non-static NewGRFs query them in the context of network games. This makes it impossible for static NewGRFs to disable non-static NewGRFs and 'bad' things happening because the non-static NewGRF doesn't know about the static NewGRF (r13576)
* Fix: Properly count number of non-north housetiles [FS#2083] (r13518)
* Fix: Incorrect usage of strtoul (r13508)
* Fix: Clear the memory for the new AI during the loading of a savegame so it does not try to execute commands generated in a different savegame, which could be resulting in the AI trying to give orders to stations that do not exist (r13505)
* Fix: Drawing of zoomed out partial sprites could cause deadlocks or crashes (r13502)
* Fix: First determine where to *exactly* build a house before asking a NewGRF whether the location is good instead of possibly moving the house a tile after the NewGRF said the location is good (r13489)
* Fix: Track was not removed on company bankrupcy when there was a ship on lower halftile (r13488)
* Fix: Let ships also navigate on half-tile sloped watery rail tiles (r13485)
* Fix: Division by zero when one would press 'd' (skip order) when there's no order (r13409)
* Fix: Do not crash when resolving vehicle sprite groups with zero sprites (r13397)
* Fix: In the purchase list, CB36 for capacity was not called for the first part of rail and road vehicles (r13385)
* Fix: Loading of very old OpenTTD savegames was broken (r13373)
