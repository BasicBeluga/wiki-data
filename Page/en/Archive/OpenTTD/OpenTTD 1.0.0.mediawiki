* Change: Show different texts in town GUI when the town does not need food the whole year to grow (r18433)
* Change: Make road vehicles behave more like trains 'around' stations and use pathfinder penalties to determine to which 'part' to go (r18382)
* Change: Do not split up articulated vehicles in the train details view. If an articulated vehicle it too 'wide' draw the information on the next line and if there are multiple cargos split that over multiple lines too {{en/Flyspray|2923}} (r18344)
* Change: Make pause on join pause during the whole joining (including download) phase {{en/Flyspray|3287}} (r18054)
* Change: Prefer extmidi over allegro midi and allegro over null driver {{en/Flyspray|3272}} (r17875)
* Change: Several improvements to the performance of CargoPackets/CargoLists; time spent in those functions reduces by 55-85% (r17840, r17836, r17818, r17814, r17812, r17801, r17736, r17735, r17733, r17731, r17730)
* Change: [SDL] make 'update the video card'-process asynchronious. Improvements of 2%-25% (real time) during fast forward on dual core/hyperthreading-enabled CPUs (r17776)
* Change: [NoAI] Make AIEngine:CanRefitCargo() not report refittability to Mail by default for aircraft. It is not necessarily true, and the special case of carrying both passenger&mail is better handled by AIs themself than by the API (r17719)
* Change: [OSX] Do not use deprecated methods/undocumented functions {{en/Flyspray|1411}} (r17712, r17711)
* Change: Make SDL's video driver more likely to be loaded than Allegro's video driver; SDL seems to perform better (r17583)
* Change: Do not assume that there is always 'another' industry tile after two '0x18' industry tiles (r17521)
* Change: Make the performance ratings harder to exploit; only count profitable vehicles and recently serviced stations {{en/Flyspray|2459}} (r17485)
* Change: When removing a station or waypoint keep the rail unless Ctrl is pressed. This makes the behaviour consistent between the two (r17471)
* Change: Show the client id in join messages at the server (r17467)
* Change: NewGRF price modifiers now take effect everytime when loading NewGRFs instead of once on gamestart (r17433)
* Change: Make a distinction between missing and corrupted data files. If (at least) one data file is missing do not consider the set to be useable. Do also no autodetect sets with missing files (r17241)
* Change: Update MiniLZO to 2.0.3 (r17215)
* Change: Update Squirrel to 2.2.3 (r17195)
* Change: Remove UNICODE notice in windows installer (r17186)
* Change: Apply the subsidy when subsidy's destination is in station's catchment area and cargo packets originate from subsidy's source {{en/Flyspray|265}},{{en/Flyspray|2094}},{{en/Flyspray|2589}} (r17113)
* Change: Subsidies are not bound to stations after awarding anymore, they still apply to town or industry, no matter what station is used for loading and unloading. Awarded subsidies from older savegames are lost {{en/Flyspray|1134}} (r17113)
* Change: [NoAI] Add AIBaseStation as a parentclass for AIStation and AIWaypoint, and move GetName, SetName and GetLocation to AIBaseStation (r17011)
* Fix: Conditional orders were seen as 'valid' and as such aircraft with only conditional orders did not crash (r18615)
* Fix: Pressing default for the starting year/snow line height edit boxes of the world generation windows did not work {{en/Flyspray|3398}} (r18586)
* Fix: [OSX] Try to get a generic RGB colour space if getting the system colour profile failed {{en/Flyspray|3198}} (r18573)
* Fix: [NewGRF] House property 15 did not work {{en/Flyspray|2613}} (r18567)
* Fix: Do not try to overtake a vehicle in a road station as overtaking in a station is not allowed {{en/Flyspray|3390}} (r18561)
* Fix: Make aircraft behave the same on autoreplace/autorenew as other vehicle types (r18553)
* Fix: First do the time-since-last-service check and only then determine whether autoreplace needs to take place. This way they will not keep autoreplacing continuously on failure, but only after some timeout. Also check some minimal requirements (engine availability, refittability) and a heuristic for the needed money when sending vehicles for autoreplace {{en/Flyspray|1762}} (r18551, r18549)
* Fix: Do not account for path reservation costs when entering a signal block via a 'block' signal. This way you won't get double penalties, both red signals and reservation costs, for the block signalled tracks {{en/Flyspray|2722}} (r18535)
* Fix: [NewGRF] An industry NewGRF that defined a too small size for action0 prop 0A could cause a crash (r18527)
* Fix: Allegro does not like to work with extmidi, so warn the user about that {{en/Flyspray|3272}} (r18520)
* Fix: When you pass a signal at danger, in a PBS controlled area, do not try to do the 'safe' thing and stop, but continue going; the user wanted the train to pass the signal at danger so (s)he has to suffer the consequences. Ofcourse one can always stop the train manually {{en/Flyspray|2891}} (r18515)
* Fix: No error message was created for the first fatal NewGRF error {{en/Flyspray|3368}} (r18506)
* Fix: Improve airport movement on several airports {{en/Flyspray|3169}} (r18505)
* Fix: Autoreplace and autorenew always reset their cargo sub type to 0. Now find a sub cargo type with the exact same name and use that, otherwise fallback to 0. So cargo sub types can be maintained via autoreplace *if* the new vehicle supports the same cargo sub type {{en/Flyspray|3159}} (r18499)
* Fix: Cloning of vehicles could create vehicles with invalid cargo sub types for the build year of the vehicle. Fall back to another cargo sub type with the exact same name, otherwise fallback to cargo sub type 0 {{en/Flyspray|2616}} (r18498)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Direction is accounted for long before motion counter is updated (r18479)
* Fix: Moving vehicles around/selling vehicle in the train depot could create states that are not allowed by the NewGRF attach callback {{en/Flyspray|3146}} (r18472, r18470)
* Fix: Unselect an AI in the AI Settings window when it falls out of the range of active AIs {{en/Flyspray|3357}} (r18436)
* Fix: Road vehicles would not pick an empty drive through stop. Now they will *if* the penalty for driving around is less than the occupancy penalty {{en/Flyspray|1944}} (r18404)
* Fix: Long (articulated) road vehicles could block loading of others when the following road vehicle already got 'permission' to go to the next bay even when it could not reach it {{en/Flyspray|1495}} (r18404)
* Fix: The tree 'which one to draw' hash wasn't anywhere near random and thus showed a very visible repeated pattern when only one tree type was used {{en/Flyspray|3343}} (r18398)
* Fix: [NoAI] Make AIIndustryType::GetConstructionCost() return -1, if the industry is neither buildable nor prospectable (r18276)
* Fix: Use free type ascender/descender metrics to position font offset correctly (r18096)
* Fix: Make the 'pause' chat message when actually executing the pause command. This to prevent showing paused and especially unpaused to be shown when the state does not change. Output now mentions whether pause changes keep the game paused and what reasons for pausing there 'currently' are (r18052)
* Fix: [NoAI] Improve behaviour of (AIEngine|AIEventEnginePreview)::GetCargoType() and AIEngine::CanRefitCargo() wrt. articulated vehicles (r17898)
* Fix: [NewGRF] CB15 and CB36 (capacity) were not always called when they should {{en/Flyspray|3255}} (r17897)
* Fix: Invalidate cache of vehicle vars 40-43 after testruns of certain commands, that change them temporarily (r17894)
* Fix: [OSX] The splash image was not displayed if the Quartz video driver was used (r17793)
* Fix: Do not let aircraft drive a while over the grass when landing at high altitude airports {{en/Flyspray|3259}} (r17762
* Fix: Make the -c <config file> location relative to the current directory instead of the directory of the binary {{en/Flyspray|3247}} (r17686)
* Fix: Some semaphore signals fell outside of the signal GUI. Now the signals are properly centered which should make that problem go away {{en/Flyspray|3242}} (r17657)
* Fix: Some inconsistencies with the difficulty settings in the scenario editor. Also re-enable changing some difficulty settings (e.g. max loan) in the scenario editor {{en/Flyspray|3219}} (r17644)
* Fix: Do not accept cargo produced in the same industry; generalise and improve the check used only for valuables (r17437)
* Fix: Pay only for cargo actually delivered, not for all cargo unloaded at station; can differ with 'stockpiling' industries (r17436)
* Fix: Improve movement of aircraft; do not make turns bigger then 45 degrees while in flight, do not move while turning on the ground (r17415, r17405)
* Fix: Crash in order GUI when changing some orders with both the mouse and keyboard at the exact same time {{en/Flyspray|2859}} (r17384)
* Fix: Trains would not show smoke if the load/unload counter was not 0, though there does not seem to be a reason to check that variable anyhow anymore {{en/Flyspray|3162}} (r17352)
* Fix: One was not offered to take over bankrupt companies anymore; caused by the introduction NoAI, although NewAI had the same problem too {{en/Flyspray|2769}} (r17345)
* Fix: Minor improvements of the airport state machines (r17338, r17337, r17334)
* Fix: Road vehicles forgetting their servicing order when the path takes them away (in bird distance) from their destination first {{en/Flyspray|3057}} (r17333)
* Fix: Mention of Ctrl modifier was missing from some tooltips {{en/Flyspray|3120}} (r17300, r17297)
* Fix: Keep vehicle news and viewports following vehicles, when autoreplacing/renewing them {{en/Flyspray|3048}} (r17147)
* Fix: Inconsistency between signs of stations and waypoints {{en/Flyspray|3081}} (r17040)
* Fix: NewGRF stations would be triggering assertions for waypoints all over the place when using the more advanced station types {{en/Flyspray|2996}} (r16909)
* Fix: Skipping a 'nearest depot order' because none could be found could cause multiple orders to get skipped {{en/Flyspray|2925}} (r16457)
* Fix: Makedepend cannot handle the amount of files we have and it also miss some dependencies. So use our custom implementation of makedepend (r16307)
* Fix: Autopause and manual pausing conflict with eachother, new game + pause on new game + autopause make the game not unpause on the first join {{en/Flyspray|2864}} (r16242)
* Remove: [NoAI] AIVehicle::SkipToVehicleOrder as it was a duplicate of AIOrder.SkipToOrder (r18504)
* Remove: OPF for RVs and NTP for trains; both the oldest path finders (r18362)
* Remove: Support for gcc2. It has not been able to compile OTTD for months. All attempts to do another workaround failed (r16492)
