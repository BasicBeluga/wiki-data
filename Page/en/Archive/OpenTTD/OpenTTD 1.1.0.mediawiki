==Changelog==

===1.1.0-beta1 (2010-12-24)===

* Feature: [NewGRF] Variable 7B for accessing 60+x variables while taking the parameter from the accumulator (r21604)
* Feature: Allow to refit only the selected part of a train consist (r21567)
* Feature: Store the used OpenTTD version, base graphics set, NewGRFs and AIs in the PNG screenshots (r21558, r21553)
* Feature: Make the delay of the chat messages timing out unrelated to the number of passed game days, i.e. do not stop aging chat messages when the server is paused, and make the timeout user configurable [FS#532] (r21513, r21512)
* Feature: Vehicle lost messages for ships and road vehicles [FS#1956] (r21511, r21510)
* Feature: Diagonal tile clearing and terraforming by pressing Ctrl [FS#730] (r21500)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Use the station graphics property to determine a fallback for the depot sprites [FS#4279] (r21473)
* Feature: Add explicit make 'shared orders' an option in the orders menu (r21464)
* Feature: Make it more clear that you are stopping a shared order, and make it possible retain the order list upon unsharing [FS#3711] (r21461)

* Feature: Building while paused always works in the scenario editor [FS#1521] (r21430)
* Feature: Perform the compression of savegames to send to the client asynchronously. This will reduce the lag of the other clients to the time it takes to make the memory dump and it will speed up downloading the map as the download starts earlier (possibly with a slightly lower bandwidth due to slow compression) [FS#4284] (r21399)
* Feature: Do not store savegames to disk when transferring it from the server to a client (r21398, r21397)

* Feature: Allow entering of the new year in a text box when cheating the year [FS#4289] (r21388)
* Feature: Support for limiting the amount of (accepted) incoming data for a server (r21363)
* Feature: Natural sorting of strings using ICU [FS#4214] (r21344)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Implement action0 visual effect properties for ships and RVs (r21240)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Support callback 0x10 for RVs and ships (r21238)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Make positioning of diesel fumes and electric sparks actually work (r21230)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Support OpenTTD's genders, cases and plurals (r21216, r21211, r21209)

* Feature: [NewGRF] Add CB36 support for road vehicle property 0x15 (Speed) (r21100)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Implement stringcode 9A 0C (station name), 9A 0D (weight) (r21086, r21085)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Add CB36 support for road vehicle properties 0x13 (Power), 0x14 (Weight) and 0x18 (Tractive effort) (r21058)
* Feature: XZ/LZMA2 savegame support. New default reduces savegame size by 10 to 30% with slightly more CPU usage. With maximum settings it reduces savegame size by 20 to 30%, but that takes 7 to 14 times longer. Map saving + downloading takes, on average, 5% less (r21044)

* Feature: Hide all other industries when Ctrl+clicking an industry type in smallmap legend (r19770)
* Feature: [NewGRF] Access to random bits of houses and industries from construction callbacks 17, 28 and 2F. That is: The random bits the house/industry will start with, if construction succeeds [FS#3477] (r19744)
* Feature: A simple sprite alignment helper. It does not store the new offsets anywhere so as soon as the sprite is reloaded the offsets are gone (use a bigger sprite cache if this happens). Also anything that reloads NewGRFs (new games, loading games or (re)applying NewGRFs) clears the sprite cache and as such resets the offsets (r19723)

* Feature: Console command 'reload_newgrfs'; only available when NewGRF developer tools are enabled (r19515)
* Feature: Enter the starting year in the scenario editor by clicking at the date panel (r19397)

* Feature: [NewGRF] Action 0/1/2/3 support for NewGRF airporttiles (r19194)
* Add: [NoAI] AIOrder::IsVoidOrder to find void '(Invalid Order)' orders (r20389)
* Add: Support for MSVC 2010 (r20032)
* Add: [NoAI] AIIndustry::GetIndustryID(TileIndex) (r19773)
* Change: Make it possible to start actions that require selecting stuff (landscaping, vehicle cloning, etc) in the viewport while paused. As side-effect you will get an error message explaining the command cannot be executed because the game is paused instead of seemingly nothing happening when you click. Additional side effect of this is that you can make use of the measurement tooltip while paused [FS#4292] (r21480)
* Change: Make building aqueducts behave more like building tunnels. They cannot be built on flat (or foundationed) tiles, so there is at most one destination tile like there is only one for tunnels [FS#4153] (r21471)
* Change: Place the bridge building window under the mouse instead of somewhere randomly on the screen and change the default sort order [FS#3975] (r21460)
* Change: Make sure the client is listening, or rather receiving, our frames (r21361)
* Change: Read some metadata from (official) source tarballs so you will more likely get the right version/revision out-of-the-box (r21351)
* Change: Be more explicit that the game state can get broken by changing NewGRFs (r21335)
* Change: Use the last red instead of last red exit penalty for making sure other waypoint entries are evaluated as well when they are occupied, e.g. when there are no signals before the waypoint but a train just beyond the waypoint is stopped (like for stations) (r21271)
* Change: Do not receive money for removing the rail of non-rail rail station tiles, i.e. rail station tiles for which the NewGRF has prevented trains to be routed through (r21266)
* Change: Show a different 'lag' message when a client is lagging because of connection trouble or lagging because the client is just slow (r21254)
* Change: Mention the OpenTTD version on the console/logs when starting an OpenTTD dedicated server like we mention it in the title bar for the GUI version (r21253)
* Change: Filter stations by cargo they have a rating for instead of having cargo waiting [FS#4206] (r21144)
* Change: Limit the number of exceptions in the refittable cargo list to 7 (r21083)
* Change: Reduce the chances to accidentally break savegames with NewGRFs by limiting loading of savegames that miss NewGRFs or change NewGRF settings in-game [FS#3012] (r21116)
* Change: Tuned realistic acceleration to be a bit more realistic in order to make acceleration 'slower', which highlights the differences between vehicle types more (r21106)
* Change: Do not make client reconnect waiting time depend on the company; in coop games that does not spread clients at all, and most companies have a low number causing it not to be spread out either. Use the ClientID instead. (r21008)
* Change: Add installing options or rather options to not install certain documentation, in a similar way to GRFCodec/catcodec (r20999)
* Change: Only display liveries in the livery window if they are used by some vehicle somewhen (r20849)
* Change: [NoAI] Rename AIAbstractList to AIList (r20563)
* Change: [NoAI] AIOrder::GetOrderFlags returns AIOrder::AIOF_INVALID for void orders (r20389)
* Change: [NewGRF] Adapt vehicle var FE bit 6 to new railtypes (r20175)
* Change: [NewGRF] Call callbacks 14A, 14B and 14C after all industry variables have been assigned, so more variables are valid during the callbacks (r19907)
* Change: [NoAI] Remove HasNext() from all lists/iterators and add IsEnd() instead (r19294)
* Change: Add the default installation directory of lzo/zlib for Mac OS X/MinGW to the paths where (the headers of) those libraries are searched [FS#3638] (r19285)
* Fix: Crash due to cargo payments belonging to a non-existing company [FS#4324] (r21605)
* Fix: Company league table used stats from two quarters ago instead of last quarter [FS#4323] (r21601)

* Fix: [OSX] A double mouse cursor was shown under certain circumstances [FS#2585] (r21578)
* Fix: Show 'plant trees' button lowered on the terraform toolbar, like how other buttons are lowered when you selected a 'build' action [FS#4315] (r21539)
* Fix: 2CC recolour sprites were the same for DOS and WIN palette, thus 'dark green', 'brown', 'grey' and 'white' were wrong for DOS [FS#4312] (r21535)
* Fix: Do not apply the last signal red pathfinder penalty when the signal is a path signal [FS#4302] (r21524)
* Fix: Tooltips were not removed when their related window got closed [FS#4300] (r21477)
* Fix: Make sure the query window is only opened once per parent window/callback [FS#4298] (r21472)
* Fix: Crash when news item gets removed at just the wrong moment [FS#4180] (r21458)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Ensure the parameter for house variable 60 is the id of an original house (r21456)
* Fix: [NewGRF] A NewGRF with incomplete string codes at the end of a string could cause invalid memory reads (r21433)
* Fix: The server did not check for the paused state when allowing to execute commands [FS#3771] (r21429)
* Fix: Vehicles could be built while the game is paused. Now you can enable or disable that with a setting, which replaces the build-while-paused cheat [FS#4021] (r21428)
* Fix: Purchase lists were not invalidated when using 'resetengines' (r21374)
* Fix: Fields were not cleared under snow though they were intended to be [FS#4283] (r21367)
* Fix: New railtypes with overlays did not use the shore sprites as groundtiles for three-corner-raised slopes (at shore) [FS#4277] (r21353)

* Fix: Bogus cache mismatch warnings with desync debugging because some cache was invalidated but never reset [FS#4272] (r21338)
* Fix: Make it more likely that the savegame and transferred file are the same file and not different ones [FS#4271] (r21334)
* Fix: Use the correct font sizes when checking for missing glyphs (r21321)
* Fix: [Content] Crash when creating file download by the content download system failed (r21319)

* Fix: Under some circumstances two vehicles could leave a non drive-through road stop at once [FS#3935] (r21263)
* Fix: [NewGRF] Custom station foundations using the 'simple foundations'-method did not draw any sprite for WSE-slopes when there are foundations on both neighboured tiles in the north. As there must be at least one sprite to provide the correct offset for the groundsprite draw the (empty) default foundation sprite in that case [FS#4246] (r21262)
* Fix: The main menu error messages would not show when you had an error message open in the game while whatever triggered you to go back to the main menu (r21255)
* Fix: Rescanning AIs did not 'forget' removed AIs [FS#3952] (r21250)
* Fix: Upon rescanning AIs the new AIs would (after some time) show up in the AI list but you could not select all (r21246)
* Fix: [YAPF] Road vehicles not finding the nearest depot in some (corner) cases [FS#4130] (r21229)
* Fix: [NewGRF] The specs' cargo strings and OpenTTD's use of the clashed. Provide properties so NewGRFs can provide cargo strings tailored for OpenTTD while retaining (some) backward compatibility [FS#4172] (r21224)
* Fix: Use proper plural for the short cargo unit names (r21223)

* Fix: [OSX] Finding a fallback font failed when compiling for OSX 10.4 as it tried to match also OpenTTD-specific control characters [FS#4001] (r21197)
* Fix: Use non-interactive randomness for townnames on map generation, so they are controlled by the generation seed as well [FS#4226] (r21192)

* Fix: Station ratings were not updated (anymore) after an aircraft crashed (r21137)
* Fix: Bridge speed limits should apply to all wagons of a vehicle, not just the head of the vehicle [FS#4213] (r21136)
* Fix: Helicopter flight altitude was determined inconsistently in different places (r21119)
* Fix: Do not use the maximum track speed where the maximum vehicle speed is meant (r21107)
* Fix: Display the real maximum speed for aircraft instead of always using the engine value (r21096)
* Fix: Aircraft speed would ignore callback 36 result when it is greater than the engine speed (r21094)
* Fix: [OSX] Mouse cursor would leave footprint with 8bpp blitter when switching to full screen (r21037)
* Fix: [OSX] Properly set the palette when using the 8bpp blitter during start-up (r21036)
* Fix: Center industry gui and waypoint gui after resize [FS#4171] (r21021)

* Fix: Accidentally moving the mouse of the scrollbar arrows while pressing it clicks the button next to the arrow [FS#4071] (r20922)
* Fix: Refit costs were not shown for long cargo names [FS#4160] (r20921)
* Fix: When using non-smooth or NewGRF-economy changing production rates does not work, so allow changing the production multiplier instead (r20901)
* Fix: The station with the second highest rating was doubly penalised when distributing cargo. Now the penalty is completely removed and the granularity/precision of the distribution in increased by using fractional cargo. This should make competing stations less all-or-nothing [FS#3637] (r20857)
* Fix: Make sure (gradual) loading is properly terminated for consists with multiple cargo types. Do not stop loading if the timetabled wait is not over yet [FS#2534] (r20843)
