- Fix: [NewGRF] Make sure temporary storage is cleared before test and exec runs for DoCommands so NewGRF callbacks cannot change the result between the runs (r22996)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Tile was cleared before the object-placement callback was run, resulting in possible differences in test and exec run [FS#4775] (r22994)

- Fix: Old TTO/TTD savegames could get non-stop via orders upon savegame loading, even when those orders did not exist back then. This 'conversion' feature is something for TTDPatch and old OpenTTD savegames [FS#4716] (r22914)
- Fix: The icon would (almost) never be shown for SDL builds [FS#4617] (r22910)
