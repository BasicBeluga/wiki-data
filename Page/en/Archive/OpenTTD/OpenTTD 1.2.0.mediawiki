* Change: Use the currency -> euro conversion rate for currencies that have been replaced with the euro, so when the switch happens the conversion rate at that point is roughly that of the real world conversion rate (r23056)

* Fix: [NoAI] ScriptSign::BuildSign() returned wrong result if the sign name was too long {{en/Flyspray|4886}} (r23516)
* Fix: Drawing of newspaper headlines used different padding than the initial sizing of the window {{en/Flyspray|4884}} (r23509)

* Fix: Replace OS error messages with internal error messages when that is possible {{en/Flyspray|4594}} (r23480)
* Fix: Clear the backed up orders of a removed station as well, otherwise one could create orders to a station that was never in the original backupped orders. For example a road vehicle trying to go to a buoy {{en/Flyspray|4876}} (r23464)

* Fix: Prevent windows to be resized beyond the bounds of the (main) window {{en/Flyspray|4842}} (r23429)
* Fix: [NoAI] The AIEvent.ET_COMPANY_NEW was only triggered if a company named itself, which seems like a very odd place to do so. Trigger it when the company is created instead (r23398)
* Fix: Bring some more order in the ordering of the windows, e.g. do not let a save or load dialog get hidden by a news message {{en/Flyspray|4709}} (r23336)
* Fix: Road vehicle purchase info failed to display vehicles carrying no cargo {{en/Flyspray|4820}} (r23334)
* Fix: Abort building/moving HQ when clicking on the button again, just like when building rail, stations, etc {{en/Flyspray|4851}} (r23331)
* Fix: Change the centre of train vehicles to depend on the vehicle length instead of being fixed at 4/8th of the original vehicle length to make sure shortened vehicles do not block tiles they should not block {{en/Flyspray|2379}}, {{en/Flyspray|3569}} (r23290)
