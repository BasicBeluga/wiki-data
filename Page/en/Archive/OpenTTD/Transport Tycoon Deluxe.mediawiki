The greatest game ever, written in 1995 by [http://www.chrissawyer.com Chris Sawyer]

The basic premise of the game is to make money. Lots of money.
How do you do this? By transporting various cargoes across the world by road, rail, air and sea.

The game starts in 1930, with a few steam trains and slow vehicles. Your score is calculated in 2050, by which time you can buy supersonic aircraft and MagLev trains.

Transport Tycoon Deluxe (TTD) has many extra features over its predecessor, Transport Tycoon (TTO), including four different climates to play in and more vehicle variety.

However this was still not enough for some people, and so [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]], and later [[en/Manual/Main Page]] were created.
