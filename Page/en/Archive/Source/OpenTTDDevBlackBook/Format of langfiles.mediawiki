[[Translation:en/Archive/Source/OpenTTDDevBlackBook/Format of langfiles]]
[[Category:en/Development]]

== General Layout ==

Each entry of the langfile consits of exactly one line.

An entry is either translation, a pragma or a comment.

If you use the web translator tool, you only see translations.


The encoding is ISO-8859-15.

== Translations ==

Translations consist of a key and a translation. They are separated by a colon (:).

=== Keys ===

The key can only contain uppercase letters, numbers and the underscore (_). Each key starts with "STR_" followed by one or more well describing words.

 STR_MAPSIZE
 STR_000F_PASSENGERS
 STR_SORT_BY_DATE
 STR_0196_SHOW_LAND_OWNERS_ON_MAP

==== Cases ====

After each key, there can be a custom suffix case separated by the period (.). The case must be defined first at the beginning of the file by ##case pragma.

Examples:
 ##case 2 upper

 STR_0011_MAIL        :posta
 STR_0011_MAIL.2      :posty
 STR_0011_MAIL.upper  :Posta

Usage:
 {STRING.2}
Use the cases to make pseudo-keys. It's a big enhancement for languages containing declension, where words are different depending on context.

=== Translations ===

Translations can contain any (CHECK!) ISO-8859-15 characters.

Using curly braces {}, special commands can be inserted into the translations, which are substituted either by strgen or while the string is drawn on the screen.

Parameter replacements can be made swappable too.  This will alow one parameter that is usually at position 0 (as in : the first one ) in the translated string to be used in fact at position 1, thus swapping place with no 1.<BR>
As an example : STR_INDUSTRY_PROD_GOUP.<BR>
In english, the string reads as "{BLACK}{BIGFONT}'''{STRING}''' production at '''{INDUSTRY}''' increases {COMMA}%!"<BR>
In finnish, same string is now "{BLACK}{BIGFONT}'''{1:INDUSTRY}''' tuottaa '''{0:STRING}''' {2:COMMA}{NBSP}% entistä enemmän!"<BR>
