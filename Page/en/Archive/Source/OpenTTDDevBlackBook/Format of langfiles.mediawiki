== General Layout ==

Each entry of the langfile consits of exactly one line.

An entry is either translation, a pragma or a comment.

If you use the web translator tool, you only see translations.


The encoding is UTF-8.

== Translations ==

Translations consist of a key and a translation. They are separated by a colon (:).

=== Keys ===

The key can only contain uppercase letters, numbers and the underscore (_). Each key starts with "STR_" followed by one or more well describing words.

 STR_MAPSIZE
 STR_000F_PASSENGERS
 STR_SORT_BY_DATE
 STR_0196_SHOW_LAND_OWNERS_ON_MAP

=== Translations ===

Using curly braces {}, special commands can be inserted into the translations, which are substituted either by strgen or while the string is drawn on the screen.
