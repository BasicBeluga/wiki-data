=Adding a squirrel function=
To add a new C++ function to Squirrel, add the function declaration to one of the classes in ''src/ai/api/ai_*.hpp''.
Also add an implementation in the ''.cpp'' file.
To make Squirrel aware of the new function, generate a new Squirrel interface file with ''squirrel_export.sh''. Call that script from within the ''src/ai/api'' directory.

Then recompile OpenTTD in the usual way to include the new function available to the NoAI framework.

Finally, write some Squirrel code to use your new function.
