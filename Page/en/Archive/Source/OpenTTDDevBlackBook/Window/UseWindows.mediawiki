A window is drawn on the game screen at every <code>WE_PAINT</code> [[en/OpenTTDDevBlackBook/Window/WindowEvents|window event]].

==Opening a window==

The function <nowiki>AllocateWindowDesc</nowiki> opens a window. It should be provided with a description (<code>AllocateWindowDesc(&_mywindow_desc);</code>). It returns the window pointer of the newly created window.

;<nowiki>Example:</nowiki>

<pre>
void ShowMyNewWindow(void)
{
	AllocateWindowDesc(&_mywindow_desc);
}
</pre>

==Describing a window==

Set up a <code>WindowDesc</code> with the name you gave <code>this->InitNested()</code>.

;<nowiki>Syntax:</nowiki>

<pre>
/** Window description for my new window. */
static const WindowDesc _mywindow_desc(
	window positioning,
        default width,
        default height,
        window class,
        parent window class,
        window flags
        widget parts,
        length of widget parts
);
</pre>
You can find plenty of examples in the source code, look in a ''*_gui.cpp'' file.

===Window positioning===
The window positioning is one of the values of the ''WindowPosition'' enum defined in src/window_gui.h.

===Window classes===
A window class is a unique number that represents a (set of) windows, for example a window that displays a town has class ''WC_TOWN_VIEW''. To differentiate which town is displayed by an actual window, the latter has an additional window number.

The list of available window classes is defined by the ''WindowClass'' enum, in ''src/window_type.h''.

===Flags===
The window flags are a composition of bit values from the ''WindowDefaultFlag'' enum also defined in ''src/window_gui.h''. Use 0 if none of the flags apply.

==Setting up widgets==

:;<nowiki>Syntax:</nowiki>

<pre>
static const Widget _mywindow_widgets[] = {
{   Widget type, flags, color, position-left, position-right, position-top, position-bottom, string/image identifier, tooltip string identifier},
};
</pre>

:;<nowiki>Example:</nowiki>

<pre>
static const Widget _mywindow_widgets[] = {
{   WWT_CLOSEBOX,   RESIZE_NONE,    14,     0,    10,     0,    13, STR_00C5,         STR_018B_CLOSE_WINDOW},
{    WWT_CAPTION,   RESIZE_NONE,    14,    11,   419,     0,    13, STR_015B_OPENTTD, STR_NULL},
{      WWT_PANEL,   RESIZE_NONE,    14,     0,   419,    14,   271, 0x0,              STR_NULL},
{      WWT_FRAME,   RESIZE_NONE,    14,     5,   414,    40,   245, STR_NULL,         STR_NULL},
{    WIDGETS_END},

===Flags===

Quote from <code>window.h</code> lines 16 onwards:

<pre>
/* How the resize system works:
    First, you need to add a WWT_RESIZEBOX to the widgets, and you need
     to add the flag WDF_RESIZABLE to the window. Now the window is ready
     to resize itself.
    As you may have noticed, all widgets have a RESIZE_XXX in their line.
     This lines controls how the widgets behave on resize. RESIZE_NONE means
     it doesn't do anything. Any other option let's one of the borders
     move with the changed width/height. So if a widget has
     RESIZE_RIGHT, and the window is made 5 pixels wider by the user,
     the right of the window will also be made 5 pixels wider.
    Now, what if you want to clamp a widget to the bottom? Give it the flag
     RESIZE_TB. This is RESIZE_TOP + RESIZE_BOTTOM. Now if the window gets
     5 pixels bigger, both the top and bottom gets 5 bigger, so the whole
     widgets moves downwards without resizing, and appears to be clamped
     to the bottom. Nice aint it?
   You should know one more thing about this system. Most windows can't
    handle an increase of 1 pixel. So there is a step function, which
    let the windowsize only be changed by X pixels. You configure this
    after making the window, like this:
      w->resize.step_height = 10;
    Now the window will only change in height in steps of 10.
   You can also give a minimum width and height. The default value is
    the default height/width of the window itself. You can change this
    AFTER window-creation, with:
     w->resize.width or w->resize.height.
   That was all.. good luck, and enjoy :) -- TrueLight */

===Colors===

''For a list of available colors, see [[en/Archive/Source/OpenTTDDevBlackBook/Window/Colours]].''

==Maintaining the window==

Set up a window procedure to be run each time <code>WE_PAINT</code> is called.

:;<nowiki>Example:</nowiki>

<pre>
static void MyWindowProc(Window *w, WindowEvent *e)
{
	switch (e->event) {
		case WE_PAINT: {
			DrawWindowWidgets(w);
		}	break;
	}
}
</pre>
