'''OpenGFX''' is a set of [[en/Archive/Community/Base graphics]] for [[en/Manual/Main Page|OpenTTD]] and is the result of the [[en/Archive/Community/Graphics Replacement|8bpp Graphics Replacement Project]]. OpenGFX provides a full open source set of graphics for the original TTD graphic files. Together with [[en/Basesets/OpenSFX]] and [[en/Basesets/OpenMSX]], OpenGFX allows to play TTD without the need for the original TTD CD.
