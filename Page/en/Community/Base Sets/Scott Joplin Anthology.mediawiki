Joplin came into the Chicago "jig piano" music scene in the 1890s just as Ragtime music started to come around, and Joplin quickly found himself to be a frequently requested performer. Joplin's breakthrough in commercial music came with 1899's "Maple Leaf Rag". While Joplin never became a pop music sensation during his lifetime, he was recognized by his peers and music critics as being particularly gifted and ahead of his time. Joplin was able to use his influence in the music community to refine Ragtime music from crude piano dance music played in seedy clubs into popular music that became a classic form of art in its own right.

Joplin's classic Ragtime pieces are best enjoyed in early OpenTTD games, particularly between 1890 and 1930. This collection is available from here and will be available on BaNaNaS shortly.
