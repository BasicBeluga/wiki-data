[[Translation:en/Community/Corners]]
When using [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Realistic acceleration]], corners slow trains down a lot.  This page gives some basic advice about minimising the effects of corners.

=Basic Rules=

Trains suffer a speed limit when crossing more than one corner in the same direction at the same time.  Here are some examples:

[[File:en/Community/Corner-1x45.png|frame|left|no speed limit: only one corner]]
[[File:en/Community/Corner-2x45.png|frame|none|no speed limit: only one corner in each direction]]
[[File:en/Community/Corner-4x45-nocars.png|frame|left|no speed limit: train only ever touches one corner at once]]
[[File:en/Community/Corner-4x45.png|frame|none|speed limit!]]

=90 degree turns=

[[File:en/Community/Corner-90.png|frame|left|speed limit: 90 degree turn]]

Trains going round 90 degree turns are limited to 55kph (38mph).  There's a 
[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Vehicles#forbid-trains-and-ships-to-take-90-deg-turns|setting]] to prevent 90&deg; turns altogether.

=Recommended distances between corners=

Speed limits are based on the type of train and the number of tiles between corners.  For a list of speed limits, see [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#vehicle-speeds|Game mechanics]].  Here's a rough guide to the number of tiles you should leave between bends:

Note: Technically, the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/SH '125']] (also known as the BR 'IC125') wants 8 squares to turn, but it's not powerful enough to get up to full speed carrying that many wagons anyway.
