[[Translation:en/Community/Double-Tracks]]
Double Tracks allow you to handle trains that travel at different speeds, or protect against broken down trains.

=Double Tracks=

Double Tracks are very useful if you have a busy rail network. You always have 2 tracks for your trains, and you can build overtaking sections.
If you want to build a double-track network, you should first decide if the double tracks will be side-by-side, or if there should be a gap between them.

Side-by-side double tracks need less space, but you can't build effective overtaking sections.
Double tracks with a gap need more space, but you can build better overtaking sections.

=Maximising train speeds=

Corners slow trains down, and the tighter the corner, the slower they go.  Trains in the screenshots above will be limited to 55km/h (38mp/h) on the 90 degree turns, and there's a 
[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Vehicles#forbid-trains-and-ships-to-take-90-deg-turns|setting]] to prevent 90&deg; turns altogether.

Turning one 45&deg; bend doesn't slow a train down, but two bends in quick succession limit the speed of trains passing over them.  The exact rules are spelt out in [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#vehicle-speeds|Game mechanics]], but here's a rough guide to the number of tiles you should leave between bends:

Note: The [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/SH '125']] is the only vehicle that needs 8 squares to turn in.  Other trains of the period need 6 tracks.
