[[Translation:en/Community/Double-Tracks]]
Double Tracks are very useful if you have a big railnetwork, which is very busy. You always have 2 Tracks for your trains to go, and you can build overtaking-sections.
If you want to build a double-track network, you should first decide if the double tracks shall be side-by-side, or if there should be one free line, like in the picture.

Side-by-side double tracks need less space, but you can't build effective overtaking sections.
Double tracks with one free space need more space, but you can build very effective overtaking sections.
