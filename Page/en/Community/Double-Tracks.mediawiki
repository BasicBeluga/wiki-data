[[Translation:en/Community/Double-Tracks]]
Double Tracks are very useful if you have a big railnetwork, which is very busy. You always have 2 Tracks for your trains to go, and you can build overtaking-sections.
If you want to build a double-track network, you should first decide if the double tracks shall be side-by-side, or if there should be one free line, like in the picture.

Side-by-side double tracks need less space, but you can't build effective overtaking sections.
Double tracks with one free space need more space, but you can build very effective overtaking sections.

{{en/Note|Do not use sharp corners as shown in the screenshots unless you have to. It is possible to spread all the above out which allows trains to travel faster. Trains can only do 55kmph (38mph on the 90 degree ones)on those sharp turns!}}
