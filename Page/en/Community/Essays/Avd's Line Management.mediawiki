I have the feeling that many people, like me, are unhappy with the current shared orders features. While I have heard some requests to ban the current vehicles clone system, I wasn't happy with that choose. I felt more that the cloned orders are incompleet, and my hope is, by adding some more features for better vehicle management, to improve the game with much better management and easier sorting.

Current fase: '''draft''' of an ui (not implementation, not coding, through limitations should be know)

== Overview implementing features ==

* Routes with support for templates (simple for now)
* Route manager, for route managing (orders, shared orders and routes)
* Filters for better management over te orders collections
* Better lists (directory system)

== Differences between route, shared order and simple orders ==

=== Simple orders ===

Allows players to create simple orders, ideal for a small network with few vehicles.

=== Shared orders ===

Allows players to group trains with the same orders, and allows you to give orders for many vehicles at the same time.

=== Routes (or incomplete (shared) orders) *NEW*===

Abstracts of shared orders (but not depending on it). Allows grouping of same-like orders.

Should support subroutes (routes with more details - thanks to templating), connecting vehicles with shared orders, or no shared orders at all.

It wil also support routes of multiple types of vehicles (where allowed) - Routes are self vehicle type independent

== Vehicle management ==

The vehicle management would not change much on the first view, with the exception of 2 changes:

* There are subgroups of groups, allowing subgrouping of trains. In the front of each group, there would be 2 icons;<br />1 for the content of the current group and 1 for the content of the whole group (including subgroups).<br /> Support for saving filters would be great, but moving the filtered trains into a group would be very great.

Note that this filtering system can also be implemented in the routemanagers, but instead of moving the results in groups, we could group them in orders, shared orders or routes and may require some other filters (with focus on orders).

* Above the groups, there is an option to add filters (like a mailbox). Defining what features would make its currently out of my scope, but it would be great if there was support for filtering by groups (or not grouped trains), filter between values like age, profit of previous year etc. and support for multiple filters (in combination with logical operations like and, or, not).
