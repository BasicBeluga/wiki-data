Current fase: draft

== Overview implementing features ==

* Routes with support for templates (simple for now)
* Route manager, for route managing (orders, shared orders and routes)
* Filters for better management over te orders collections
* Better lists (directory system)

== Differences between route, shared order and simple orders ==

=== Simple orders ===

Allows players to create simple orders, ideal for a small network with few vehicles.

=== Shared orders ===

Allows players to group trains with the same orders, and allows you to give orders for many vehicles at the same time.

=== Routes ===

Abstracts of shared orders (but not depending on it). Allows grouping of same-like orders.

Should support subroutes (routes with more details - thanks to templating), connecting vehicles with shared orders, or no shared orders at all.
