Current fase: draft

== Overview implementing features ==

* Routes with support for templates (simple for now)
* Route manager, for route managing (orders, shared orders and routes)
* Filters for better management over te orders collections
* Better lists (directory system)

== Differences between route, shared order and simple orders ==

=== Simple orders ===

Allows players to create simple orders, ideal for a small network with few vehicles.

=== Shared orders ===

Allows players to group trains with the same orders, and allows you to give orders for many vehicles at the same time.

=== Routes ===

Abstracts of shared orders (but not depending on it). Allows grouping of same-like orders.

Should support subroutes (routes with more details - thanks to templating), connecting vehicles with shared orders, or no shared orders at all.

It also supports routes independent of vehicles (where allowed)

== Vehicle management ==

The vehicle management would not change much on the first view, except 2 big changes:

* There are subgroups of groups, allowing subgrouping of trains. In the front of each group, there would be 2 icons;
1 for the content of the current group and 1 for the content of the whole group (including subgroups).

* Above the groups, there is an option to add filters (like a mailbox). Defining what features would make its currently out of my scope, but it would be great if there was support for filtering by groups (or not grouped trains), filter between values like age, profit etc. and support for multiple filters (in combination with logical operations like and, or, not).
