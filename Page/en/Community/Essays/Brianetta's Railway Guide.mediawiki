=Brianetta's Railway Guide=
==Introduction==
Hello!

I've been playing TTD and OpenTTD since late 1994.  I'm a big fan of railways, and although I will use other modes of transport it's the whole logical aspect of track, signals and trains that really keeps me playing year after year.  Over the years, I've developed a few techniques with respect to railways.  Some of them are rather uncommon, and I thought I'd finally share them with the community at large.
==Brianetta's style==
Those who watch me play online will notice that my railway networks are often very small indeed.  There will be stretches of single track, two-way track, and sometimes a mixture of types of train.  Another thing that will be noticed is that it's an extremely rare occurrence for my railway networks to jam up.  This is a direct result of the fact that my networks are uncomplicated.

While working on a railway network in TTD you are, in effect, doing the same kind of thinking that a programmer is doing.  You're holding a lot of state in your head.  Sometimes you're mentally simulating your layout; other times you're holding a complex picture in your mind, which you then build for real on the terrain.  All of this thinking has to be maintained while you're being interrupted by other aspects of the game, such as waiting for cash, or responding to changes of production at industries you serve.

Making an effective network is easier if you're not holding an awful lot of complex state in your mind.  Networks which are simple to understand are easier to plan, even with interruptions.  It's easier to spot what's wrong, when things are not acting as expected.  A simple network is far more robust.  Less can go wrong because less can happen in the first place.

So, the style that comes from this approach is one of simplicity.  Long signal blocks are more simple than short ones.  Trains don't occupy more than two at once, and they have a bit of room between them.  Mainlines are made up of two tracks, with a little gap between them occasionally.  Branch lines are often just a single track, with perhaps a couple of passing places if they're long ones.  The infrastructure is cheap.  It's not as profitable as some of the more elaborate play styles going around, but it's easily profitable enough to both sustain itself and allow growth.  Think small and functional.

==Networks that don't jam==
A network jams up if there's ever a situation where a train has to stop and wait for itself to move.  If you plan your network so that a train never has to wait for itself to move before it can move, your network won't ever jam.  Let me re-iterate that:  It won't ''ever'' jam.

When you plan a route, also plan how many trains you want to run on it.  Think about where these trains will wait if things get busy, and make sure that there's room for them all.  Try to avoid the paradigm of building general purpose highway style lines; all lines have a finite capacity.  If you run lots of trains, they will often have to wait for each other.  If you run too many, then eventually they'll have to wait for themselves, and that's a jam.

Rather than making a huge mainline with a huge capacity, then adding trains to it until you find the upper limit of its capacity the hard way, it's easier to keep things quiet.  Design for a certain target capacity.  If later services would overload it, think about adding relief lines - and know how many trains they can hold, too.  If every train has its place, you won't be wondering whether it'll keep working forever.

==A simple train line==
A railway line starts with a plan.  Decide first where it's ultimately going to go.  The idea isn't to build it all in one go, but to start off with a section of it, and to get it in revenue service.

My main railway lines have two one-way tracks.  Stations on the railway line have two platforms if quiet, and four if busy.  Half of the platforms are dedicated to one direction, the other half to the other.  Nothing fancy.  No turning loops, no crossovers, no depots.  Just a simple station where a train will stop on its way to somewhere else.

At the end of the line is a terminus.  Very occasionally I'll use a roll-on, roll-off style station, where every train moves through the station in the same direction.  More often, I'll use a traditional bay platform terminus, where trains leave the platform by the way they came in.

At a temporary terminus, I use a slightly modified inline station (the type I described first, above) where trains go through in one direction, then turn around and go through again in the other.
