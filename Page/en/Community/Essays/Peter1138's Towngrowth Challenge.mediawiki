==Towngrowth Challenge (TC) gameplay goals:==

Each game started with TC has a population goal set, which can be defined at the beginning of the game and is immutable once the game has started. Once a company's claimed population reaches the population goal, that company wins the game. After the game is won, play can continue in the normal fashion but without scoring (like in regular ttd). The normal ttd game rules still count, so construction still costs money and a company losing too much money will go bankrupt.

additional rules and definitions:
* the claimed population of a company is the sum of the population of all towns claimed by that company
* a town is claimed by the company that delivered the highest amount of cargo units to it. The cargo that counts towards this are passengers, mail, water, food, goods and valuables

With these rules the challenge becomes to make the towns you have claimed grow. But other than in normal ttd, the towns do not grow unless their demands are met.
 
TC introduces 7 classifications for towns:
The cargo deliveries mentioned are on a per month basis.
 
{|
|-
| community||
* A small settlement of up to 300 inhabitants. 
* Communities demand either passengers or mail delivered to grow. 
* When a community is smaller than 150, it will grow on its own to make sure passenger transport is possible.
|-
| village||
* A village has 300 up to 600 inhabitants.
* Villages require both passengers and mail delivered to grow.
|-
| township||
* Townships are villages on the edge of becoming a town, they have from 600 up to a 1000 inhabitants.
* Townships require a larger amount of passengers and mail delivered, plus either a supply of water or food before they'll grow
|-
| town||
* Towns are small larger concentrations of people of 1000 to 3000 inhabitants.
* Towns require even more passengers and mail, plus both food and water to grow.
|-
| city||
* A city can have from 3000 up to 6000 inhabitants.
* Cities require large amounts of passengeers and mail, larger amounts of food and water, and either goods or valuables to grow.
|-
| metropolis||
* A metropolis is a thriving hub of civilization with a minimum of 6000 and a maximum of 15000 inhabitants.
* A metropolis requires all cargo: large amounts of passengers and mail, serious amounts of food and water and both goods and valuables before it will grow.
|-
| capital||
* A capital is the largest size a town can be in TC. 
* It allows for a small amount of growth under the same requirements as a metropolis up to 15500 inhabitants, to avoid a town bouncing between metropolis and capital.
* Once at or over 15500 inhabitants, it can no longer grow.
|-
|}

Towns track how many units of cargo they have received from all companies since start of game. The company with the highest amount has claim of the town and its population counts towards this company's population total.
Cargo supplied to a power station belonging to a town counts as power for the town. A town with sufficient power (power demand depends on town size) grows 4 times faster than a town without power.

==Cargo and industries==
there are 3 types of industries in TC, internally classified as primary, secondary and tertiary industries.

* Primary industries produce raw materials. These are the mines, plantations, etc.

* Secondary industries process materials into cargo. Sometimes the resulting cargo requires more processing at another secondary industry. These are the factories and refineries.

* Tertiary industries accept cargo. These industries service the towns, they are the water tower, banks, shopping mall and power station.

Only secondary industries can be funded (in fact, they will not start on their own). Tertiary industries can be funded through the town authorities, who will then decide on their own where to build that industry.

Only primary industries start as new random industries during the game.

Oilwells act like other primary industries, so they do not forcibly close down.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> For compatibility this is in Steel's cargo slot.

Toys do not provide any function other than to create an easy type of cargo to earn some money with by transporting it from a factory to a shopping mall, which can be invaluable while setting up a large distribution network. ''To lessen code impact, Toys and Rubber were scrapped.''
