==Towngrowth Challenge (TC) gameplay goals:==

Each game started with TC has a population goal set, which can be defined at the beginning of the game and is immutable once the game has started. Once a company's claimed population reaches the population goal, that company wins the game. After the game is won, play can continue in the normal fashion but without scoring (like in regular ttd). The normal ttd game rules still count, so construction still costs money and a company losing too much money will go bankrupt.

additional rules and definitions:
* the claimed population of a company is the sum of the population of all towns claimed by that company
* a town is claimed by the company that delivered the highest amount of cargo units to it. The cargo that counts towards this are passengers, mail, water, food, goods and valuables

With these rules the challenge becomes to make the towns you have claimed grow. But other than in normal ttd, the towns do not grow unless their demands are met.
 
TC introduces 7 classifications for towns:
The cargo deliveries mentioned are on a per month basis.
 
{|
|-
| community||
* A small settlement of up to 300 inhabitants. 
* Communities demand either passengers or mail delivered to grow. 
* When a community is smaller than 150, it will grow on its own to make sure passenger transport is possible.
|-
| village||
* A village has 300 up to 600 inhabitants.
* Villages require both passengers and mail delivered to grow.
|-
| township||
* Townships are villages on the edge of becoming a town, they have from 600 up to a 1000 inhabitants.
* Townships require a larger amount of passengers and mail delivered, plus either a supply of water or food before they'll grow
|-
| town||
* Towns are small larger concentrations of people of 1000 to 3000 inhabitants.
* Towns require even more passengers and mail, plus both food and water to grow.
|-
| city||
* A city can have from 3000 up to 6000 inhabitants.
* Cities require 
|-
| metropolis||
* A metropolis is a thriving hub of civilization with a minimum of 6000 and a maximum of 15000 inhabitants.
* A metropolis requires all cargo: large amounts of passengers and mail, serious amounts of food and water and both goods and valuables before it will grow.
|-
| capital||
* A capital is the largest size a town can be in TC. 
* It allows for a small amount of growth under the same requirements as a metropolis up to 15500 inhabitants, to avoid a town bouncing between metropolis and capital.
* Once at or over 15500 inhabitants, it can no longer grow.
|-
|}

Towns track how many units of cargo they have received from all companies since start of game. The company with the highest amount has claim of the town and its population counts towards this company's population total.
Cargo supplied to a power station belonging to a town counts as power for the town. A town with sufficient power (power demand depends on town size) grows 4 times faster than a town without power.

==Cargo and industries==
there are 3 types of industries in TC, internally classified as primary, secondary and tertiary industries.

* Primary industries produce raw materials. These are the mines, plantations, etc.

* Secondary industries process materials into cargo. Sometimes the resulting cargo requires more processing at another secondary industry. These are the factories and refineries.

* Tertiary industries accept cargo. These industries service the towns, they are the water tower, banks, shopping mall and power station.

Only secondary industries can be funded (in fact, they will not start on their own). Tertiary industries can be funded through the town authorities, who will then decide on their own where to build that industry.

Only primary industries start as new random industries during the game.

Oilwells act like other primary industries, so they do not

<nowiki>*</nowiki> For compatibility this is in Steel's cargo slot.

Toys do not provide any function other than to create an easy type of cargo to earn some money with by transporting it from a factory to a shopping mall, which can be invaluable while setting up a large distribution network.

==required programming changes==

* industries must accept at least 4 cargo types (should be done already)
* support must exist for at least 20 cargo types, preferably more [32 already allowed]

* town claiming
* town cargo delivered
* town growth depending on cargo delivered
* disallow building of statues and fountains in towns, those drop population [newhouses]
* disallow building of shopping mall, it is now an industry [newhouses]
* add food acceptance to buildings (in addition to other acceptance) [newhouses]

* make oil wells behave like normal industries, so no forced closing down [newindustries]
* water provided to a water tower counts as water supplied to the town
* food provided to a shopping mall counts as food supplied to the town (in addition to buildings)
* goods provided to a shopping mall counts as food supplied to the town
* valuables provided to a shopping mall or bank counts as food supplied to the town
* do not accept passengers or mail originating from the same town

* allow all vehicles that are refittable to refit to all cargo types [newgrf, but is this necessary?]
* check for winning conditions and if they are met do game won stuff

* show company logo and name of claiming company

===Town authority gui===
* add 3 options: Fund water tower (cheap), Fund shopping mall (moderately expensive), Fund power station (expensive)

* on the y axis, instead of company value, show claimed population ''Why not both?''

===(new) game win gui===
* show player company name, player name and portrait of winner
* show amount of days played since game start
* show amount of cargo transported

==required grf changes==
