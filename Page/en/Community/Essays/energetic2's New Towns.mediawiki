[[Translation:en/Community/Essays/energetic2's New Towns]]
NewTowns is a proposal for OpenTTD to implement a better economy and better gameplay for towns. It is inspired on the many servers where players are competing for the biggest town. Most knowledge assembled and presented in this article comes straight from implemented ideas on those servers.

==Status==
Currently (August 9th 2010) this is a proposal in alpha status. Most ideas presented here are not yet well described, neither checked on technical feasability with the devs of OpenTTD. 

==What is a town?==
Towns/cities are places where economic activity is present, attracting inhabitants for work. in turn, more inhabitants in towns generate more economic activity. The relation between inhabitants and economic activity goes therefore two-ways. A town is therefore a place offering economic possibilities and places to live.

==What makes a town grow?==
The most important factor of town growth is economic activity. Therefore, in OpenTTD town growth should be largely dependant on economic activity surrounding the town. Without economic activity, towns gradually shrink since inhabitants don't have any possibilty to employ themselves. 
Other factors include, but are not limited to (this list should be completed):
* Public transport system quality
* Traffic system quality (jams)
* Geological location of the town (space to extend)

==Town anatomy==
A town consists of 4 major parts:
* (mostly secondary) Industries (factory, bank)
* Offices (office buildings seen in the center of town)
* Houses
* Infrastructure (roads/rail/air)

==What is economic activity?==
In OpenTTD, economic activity are activities performed in industries. Since the definition of an industry in OpenTTD also encompasses houses & offices, passenger & mail transport also include economic activity.

==How should towns grow?==
Town growth appears usually in areas of economic activity. For instance, when a player adds a passengers station, this is considered economic activity. Buildings will appear next to the station. Another example is a factory. Near factories, other industries should open.
Some prerequisits should be present to allow a town to grow. Those are
* Local public transport service
* Space assingment for growth of communities, offices and industries
* Serviced industries
Growth of towns can be further increased with:
* Meeting cargo requirements of the town
* Doubling the cargo requirements to enable development of industry centers

==HQ==
===Claiming===
Usually on town growth servers, players are required to monopolize a town by placing the HQ near the town center. When a town is "claimed", competitors are not allowed to build near the center of the town. This radius increases along with the size of the town. 
===Warehouse===
HQ's are used as a warehouse to store goods the town did not need the current month. Cargo which can be storedm such as goods, can be used the next month. HQ warehouses should become bigger when the town size increases. This should also be true for the graphics of the HQ. Currently, HQ building graphic is not determined by economic activity, but by the "performance" metric of a company. The performance metric is somewhat representable for economic activity, but it's goal is not the same. HQ's size should be determined by the size of the warehouse and the amount of economic activity performed by the company. Warehouses should be built by the player as an industry with a modular design. The size of the warehouse should generally be in proportion of the cargo throughput of the company.
===Placement===
As economic activity is spurred itself by economic activity, HQ's should be encouraged to build in the center of the town. When doing so, the company increases the economic activity in town, and as such is spurring growth of the town. The economic activity growth factor realized by having the HQ in the center should be based on the scale of economic activity of the company. In other words, when the company is doing well, the HQ is big and has a profound influence on town growth. 

==Industry centers==
Most kinds of industries tend to develop in the same area in towns. For instance, cloth shops open usually around other cloth shops. Financial companies tend to move to areas where already financial companies are. This fact should be resembled in town growth. 
===Developing===
An industry center can be developed by offering double the amount of the required cargo type over a certain period of time. Banks may grow, and new banks may open, because the valuables economic activity is high. As banks grow and new banks appear near current banks, demand increases suppring the growth of banks further. 
===Becoming===
A prerequisite for industry centers is having company HQ (not OpenTTD companies, but newGRF tagged with HQ) buildings in the industry cluster. 
Clusters of certain industry become industry centers when a continuous, steady flow of cargo is brought to town (consistent economic activity). For instance, when all banks are serviced for 200% their needs over a timespan of, say 2 years, the country instance (game engine) may decide the cluster of industries become an industry center. 
===Advantages===
Industry centers attract HQ's of companies (newGRF's tagged with HQ). Company HQ's are interesting for towns, as they generate a lot of economic activity (and thus growth). 
===Losing status===
Industry centers may be lost to a town, because of not meeting requirements for a certain amount of time. 
===Properties===
* Only one industry center of a cargo type may exist on a map (one financial center, one production center, etc)
* At least one HQ newGRF needed to become industry center
* Multiple industry centers are possible in a town
* Industry centers dramatically increase chances of more HQ newgrfs

==HQ newGRFs==
HQ newGRFs, not to mixup with the players' company HQ's, are newGRFs of big buildings and industries unique in a game (a company generally has only one HQ).
While the HQ newGRFs are unique in a game, multiple HQ newGRFs may exist of the same typ of cargo. For instance, a Bank of America HQ newGRF may exist alongside a JP/Morgan newGRF.

==Buildings==
Various grades of town buildings exist.
===Houses===
Houses are small buildings only for residential use.
===Suburban buildings===
Suburban buildings are small buildings offering peripheral functions
===Apartment blocks===
Apartment blocks are buildings housing multiple homes, and are situated closer to centers.
===Office towers===
Office towers appear generally in centers, and consist of office companies and residential area. 

===Cargo Industries===
Cargo industries are generally placed at the outskirts of a town.
