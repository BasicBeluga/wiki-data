==Problems with (O)TTDs economic model==

At various occasions people have stated that OpenTTDs economic model is far from optimal. Complaints usually focus on the ability to gain large amounts of money with too little effort. The lack of opportunities to spend the money makes the game very easy in later stages. As with enough money the performance measures easy to manipulate the performance rating shown in 2051 seems fairly arbitrary. Especially air planes give the player an opportunity to make an enormous amount of money with very little effort. Thus, the economic model has frequently been called '''unbalanced'''.

Additionally the whole game is centered around money as '''the''' performance rating. This makes sense when viewing the game as a simulation of reality. In reality transport companies are subject to the laws of capitalism which makes the profit they generate their performance rating. This is where the analogy ends. If OpenTTD is a simulation of capitalist economy it is very shallow. People have already complained about the lack of a proper stock market, the lack of a more detailed bank system, the lack of taxes and other shortcomings. Obviously, once you have reached a certain level, it isn't possible anymore to play the game with a truly '''capitalist''' mindset. Money quickly becomes abundant and the game gets too easy. What keeps people playing the game afterwards are entirely different things.

And, to make my personal motivation clear: '''Capitalism is boring. I want something else.'''

==Cheating the economic model==

You can watch the lack of capitalist mindset in the games played by the [http://openttdcoop.org OpenTTDCoop community]. Most times they play cooperatively and set themselves goals outside or even conflicting with the economic model. Certain elements of their games still need to conform to that model in order to keep the game running, but those are commonly regarded as mere formal excercizes and named accordingly ("moneymaker"). Obviously, due to the weakness of the economic model, it is rather easy to subvert it and play your own game. This is widely regarded as a strength, not as a weakness of the game.

==Criteria for a new economic model==

Concluding from those observations some criteria for an alternate economic model can be formulated:
* The new model should provide a challenge, even in later stages of the game. Critical resources should never become abundant.
* The model doesn't need to mirror capitalist economy. People will still play the game if it's governed by other rules.
* The new model should be scalable in difficulty. People need to be able to define goals on their own.
* The new model should be optional. My changes will be pretty controversial and anyone could revert them anyway.
* The new model should keep compatibility to the NewGRF specification where it includes economic aspects.

==A suggestion==
Building on [[en/Manual/Passenger and cargo distribution]] a system can be designed that meets those criteria. First of all, a very radical change:

 In the alternate economic model you will not be paid for individual shipments of cargo.

Instead you get money from towns supporting you. Another radical change is the final performance rating which won't include any monetary values. Instead the aggregated town ratings and/or service levels will be included. Some new concepts are introduced which need some clarification:

===Service Level===
The service level of a company in a town is calculated from the amount of cargo - passengers, mail, cargo from nearby industries - generated in or near the town that has been delivered to the correct destination. The destination is chosen by cargodist, if that's enabled. Otherwise it's any destination. That amount is taken as percentage of the theoretical maximum amount of cargo the town could generate. It is weighted by the speed of delivery similar to the way cargo payments are weighted. The classical town rating could perhaps be completely replaced with the service level. This arrangement needs some further thoughts, though.

===Supply Scaling===
The station rating is scaled by the amount of accepting tiles reachable from stations in the network. This number is calculated when calculating the link graph component the station belongs to. It is taken as fraction of the overall number of accepting tiles for this cargo in the map. There will be a configurable minimum and maximum for that scaling factor. The computed number represents a fraction of their difference. 

===Town Support===
When the service level of a company in a town surpasses a certain amount the town decides to '''support''' the company. When the service level falls below a certain amount the town drops support. "Support" means that the entire transport budget of that town is given to the company. The budget depends only on the number of inhabitants a town has. The amount each inhabitant contributes to the budget is configurable. The budget is paid either once per year or once per month. This still has to be decided on. Generally this means there is a first come, first serve principle. Once a company has a town's support another company can only aqcuire it if the first company's service level falls below the threshold. Additional settings can be introduced here, but making it hard to gain town support is essential to the concept. Service levels needed for town support rise and fall with the overall number of accepting tiles reachable from stations in any network. This number is taken as fraction of all accepting tiles. The minimum and maximum service levels needed for town support can be configured similar to the supply scaling range. The town where you build your first piece of infrastructure automatically supports you if it doesn't support another company already.

===Losing, Merging and Debt===
If no town supports you, you lose the game - no matter how much money you have left. However, if you run into debt, you don't lose the game. Instead your company is auto-merged with a rich other company. If no other company is left or after merging with any other company you'd still be in debt, your stations, tracks and vehicles will start disappearing instead. The check is regularly rerun until you are either merged or you are out of debt or you have lost due to losing support of the last town. The stock market is removed. You can't buy other companies anymore.

===Conclusions===

Obviously this model can be configured to be very hard by setting the budget modifier very low and the required service levels very high. It can also be configured to be very easy by doing the opposite. It can be kept optional as it is composed of several isolated changes most of which can also be used with the current model. It doesn't interfer with any NewGRFs I can think of, except perhaps NewGRF defined cargo payment rates which are only partly respected by factoring in the speed factor into the service level. And, especially when someone is running into problems, it will provide for some interesting twists.
