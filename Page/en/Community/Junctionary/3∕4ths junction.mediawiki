This type of junction is terrible. Avoid it at all costs.

'''Pros:'''
*Cheap
*Small
*Effective
*No sharp turns, it doesn't slow trains
*Slope only in the one way of railway
*Usefull for fast, serial construction
*Trains in line direction are not slowed, or slowed only a bit and are not blocked themselves
*Eesy to remember

'''Cons:'''
*One way of railway have to climb slope
*Trains arriving from northeast or southwest are unable to turn left.
*Trains cannot do "U" move(you can add it, but these "U" moves could cause jams)

If you want to do "U" move with trains, only add this to the end of junction.

"PS: Jams doesn't exists... I want to say, that you can have huge junction for a 50 trains, but trains have to join same track after. So why to build a huges junctions? It takes too much times."
