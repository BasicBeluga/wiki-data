'''Pros:'''
*Cheap
*Small
*Effective
*No sharp turns, it doesn't slow trains
*Slope only in the one way of railway
*Usefull for fast, serial construction
*Trains in line direction are not slowed, or slowed only a bit
*Eesy to remember

'''Cons:'''
*One way of railway have to climb slope
*Trains cannot do "U" move(u can add it, but these trains cause jams)

If u want to do "U" move with trains, only add this to the end of junction.

"PS: Jams doesn't exists... I want to say, that you can have huge junction for a 50 trains, but trains have to join same track after. So why to build a huges junctions? It takes too much times."
