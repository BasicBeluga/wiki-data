[[Translation:en/Community/Junctionary/Advanced Roundabout]]
Unlike the Complex Round-A-Bout, this RAB is 1 level above the default Track-Level. Trains can pass at streight at very high speeds, but can cause a traffic-jam more easy by looping around (those who turn left).

Some Problems are minimized by using pre-signals

'''Pros:'''
*Can handle lots of trains moving N-E or S-W
*Tracks splits and only trains going to the left need to take the round-a-bout
*Full speed for streight and right-turning trains

'''Cons:'''
*Longer trains (3 tiles +) have to slow down for left-turns
*Costly to build.

'''Optinal construction tips:'''
*To allow left-turning trains traveling at full speed through the round-a-bout, its possible to enlarge the circle, but this takes a lot of space to build.
