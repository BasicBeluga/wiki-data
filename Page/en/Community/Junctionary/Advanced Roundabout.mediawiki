Unlike the basic [[en/Community/Junctionary/Roundabout]], this junction has 1 level above the default Track-Level. Trains can pass straight through and turn right without entering the circle.

Some problems are minimized by using [[en/Manual/Signals#pre-signals|pre-signals]]

'''Pros:'''
*Can handle lots of trains moving N-E or S-W
*Tracks split and only trains going to the left need to take the round-a-bout
*Full speed for straight and right-turning trains

'''Cons:'''
*Gridlock possible.
*Longer trains (3 tiles +) have to slow down for left-turns
*Costly to build.
*Trains moving N-W or S-E (and also trains turning left) must slow down to climb a slope.

'''Optional construction tips:'''
*To allow left-turning trains traveling at full speed through the roundabout, its possible to enlarge the circle, but this takes a lot of space to build.
