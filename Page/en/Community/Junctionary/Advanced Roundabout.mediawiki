{{en/Community/Junctionary/Navigation}}

Unlike the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Complex Star Junction]], this roundabout is 1 level above the default Track-Level. Trains can pass straight at very high speeds, but those who turn left can cause a traffic-jam more easily by looping around.

Some problems are minimized by using [[en/Community/Junctionary/Advanced signalling examples|pre-signals]]

'''Pros:'''
*Can handle lots of trains moving N-E or S-W
*Tracks split and only trains going to the left need to take the round-a-bout
*Full speed for straight and right-turning trains

'''Cons:'''
*Longer trains (3 tiles +) have to slow down for left-turns
*Costly to build.

'''Optional construction tips:'''
*To allow left-turning trains traveling at full speed through the roundabout, its possible to enlarge the circle, but this takes a lot of space to build.
