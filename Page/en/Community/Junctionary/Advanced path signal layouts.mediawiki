This article displays some advanced [[en/Archive/Manual/Yet Another PBS Patch|YAPP]] track layouts. Please note that several of these track layouts are controversial. See the discussion page for more information.

====Advanced junction with crossover====
The crossover increases the chance that a train finds a path, even if the junction is occupied by a train from the opposite direction.

====Advanced two-way station====
At heavily used two-way stations sometimes deadlock can occur. The use of one-way PBS signals dedicates a platform to one specific direction, which decreases the chance of a deadlock. (Most of the times a deadlock occurs when all platforms are occupied by trains wanting to travel in the same direction, but the way out is clogged)

====Advanced two-way quadruple track layout====
Still playing with breakdowns, aren't you? This layout solves all your problems.

====High capacity railway station====
This is an example of a compact and high performance [[en/Manual/Railway station#ro-ro|RoRo station]] design. The greatest attention has been paid on the entrance tracks. Not only they are easy to build, but efficiency is also maintained. If many platforms are free, trains will keep filling them without any major stops.

You will also notice, that the station is divided into two sides. Vehicles that come from Side A will try to occupy Side's A platforms. Same goes with Side B. When traffic load gets lower or many platforms are filled, trains will also occupy adjacent side if it is better/faster. NOTE: it is worth building a [http://www.openttdcoop.org/wiki/Guides:Load_Balancers#Simple_track_switching load balancer] after this station as trains don't have a choice over two exiting tracks.
