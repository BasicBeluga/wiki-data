{{en/Note|The generic information to do with signals is currently being emptied from this page into [[en/Manual/Signals]].  The numerous presignal examples will be left in and this page turned into a stock of example signalling setups instead of just an extension of the Signals page.  While this is in progress, expect the page to look messy.}}

A pre-signal with no exit signals will behave as a normal signal, to allow the use of two-way pre-signals (where the other direction would usually lead to a route serviced by one train only). The pre-signal only considers actual exit signals when deciding whether to go green or remain red, even if there are other, non-exit signals that would allow a train to leave the block. Pre-signals can be either one-way or two-way signals, but will usually be one-ways. 
 
Pre-signal exits are signals leading away from the pre-signal block, and with NPF disabled, should normally be two-way signals, so as to give the train a choice. If they were one-way signals, the trains would all attempt to go to what they consider the "best" choice, even if there are other green signals they could go to as well. Therefore, with NPF disabled, an exit will in almost all cases have to be a two-way signal. NPF lifts this "restriction" and will choose the least cost path to its destination, and red signals have a higher cost than green.
 
Combo signals are a combination of both pre-signals and exits. They serve as an exit to a prior pre-signal, but are a pre-signal themselves. As such, they are to be placed between two pre-signal blocks, so that trains can go to the additional exits behind a combo signal if they need to, but the blocks are still separate and allow a train in each block. Please see below for a specific example. Note that combo signals are not as useful as they should be, because they currently have some limitations. In the case where all exits are blocked, and trains are waiting at both pre-signal blocks, both trains will start moving when one exit becomes available, but of course there is only one platform, so one train ends up waiting in the pre-signal block.

==Optimal pre-signalled station==
Below is an image of an "optimal" Pre-signal station layout.
With these signals trains will choose any free platform and if none is free it will wait at the entrance instead of brutally picking one and waiting for that train to leave.

'''Explanation of the signal types:'''
* Signals '''1''' through '''12''' are Pre-signal Exits
* Signals '''A''', '''B''', '''C''' and '''D''' are Combo Signals
* The signal '''E''' is the only Pre-signal  (Entrance)

'''How they operate:'''
* If signals '''1''', '''2''', '''3''' and '''4''' are red then signal '''A''' will be red.
* If signals '''5''', '''6''', '''7''' and '''8''' are red then signal '''B''' will be red.
* If signals '''9''', '''10''', '''11''' and '''12''' are red then signal '''D''' will be red.
* If any train is between signal '''A''' and signals '''1''', '''2''', '''3''' and '''4''' signal '''A''' will be red.
* If any train is between signal '''B''' and signals '''5''', '''6''', '''7''' and '''8''' then signal '''B''' will be red.
* If any train is between signal '''C''' and signals '''A''' and '''B''' then signal '''C''' will be red.
* If any train is between signal '''D''' and signals '''9''', '''10''', '''11''' and '''12''' then signal '''D''' will be red.
* If any train is between signal '''E''' and signals '''D''' and '''C''' then signal '''E''' will be red.
* If signals '''A''' and '''B''' are red then signal '''C''' will be red.
* If signals '''C''' and '''D''' are red then signal '''E''' will be red preventing access to the station.


Below is an animation of how this would work in the game.

As the animation shows trains can choose any track without too many problems.

To clarify things further, below is a diagram showing a situation where Pre-Signals may be used effectively.
