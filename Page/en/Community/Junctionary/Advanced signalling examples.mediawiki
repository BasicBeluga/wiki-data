{{en/Note|The generic information to do with signals is currently being emptied from this page into [[en/Manual/Signals]].  The numerous presignal examples will be left in and this page turned into a stock of example signalling setups instead of just an extension of the Signals page.  While this is in progress, expect the page to look messy.}}

==Optimal pre-signalled station==
Below is an image of an "optimal" Pre-signal station layout.
With these signals trains will choose any free platform and if none is free it will wait at the entrance instead of brutally picking one and waiting for that train to leave.

'''Explanation of the signal types:'''
* Signals '''1''' through '''12''' are Pre-signal Exits
* Signals '''A''', '''B''', '''C''' and '''D''' are Combo Signals
* The signal '''E''' is the only Pre-signal  (Entrance)

'''How they operate:'''
* If signals '''1''', '''2''', '''3''' and '''4''' are red then signal '''A''' will be red.
* If signals '''5''', '''6''', '''7''' and '''8''' are red then signal '''B''' will be red.
* If signals '''9''', '''10''', '''11''' and '''12''' are red then signal '''D''' will be red.
* If any train is between signal '''A''' and signals '''1''', '''2''', '''3''' and '''4''' signal '''A''' will be red.
* If any train is between signal '''B''' and signals '''5''', '''6''', '''7''' and '''8''' then signal '''B''' will be red.
* If any train is between signal '''C''' and signals '''A''' and '''B''' then signal '''C''' will be red.
* If any train is between signal '''D''' and signals '''9''', '''10''', '''11''' and '''12''' then signal '''D''' will be red.
* If any train is between signal '''E''' and signals '''D''' and '''C''' then signal '''E''' will be red.
* If signals '''A''' and '''B''' are red then signal '''C''' will be red.
* If signals '''C''' and '''D''' are red then signal '''E''' will be red preventing access to the station.


Below is an animation of how this would work in the game.

As the animation shows trains can choose any track without too many problems.

To clarify things further, below is a diagram showing a situation where Pre-Signals may be used effectively.
