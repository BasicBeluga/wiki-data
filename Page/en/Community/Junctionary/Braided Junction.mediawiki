The '''Braided Junction''' is a compact branch-before-merge junction.

===Pros===
*Very compact (uses 6 extra tiles)
*Traffic jams are unlikely since tracks split before they merge.
*No loops.

===Cons===
*The slopes and the sharp turns make trains go slower.
*Signal distance is 7 tiles on straight track over the bridge.

===Variants===

Adding signals north and south of bridge will make the crossing get a 5 tile signal distance. The crossing will be slightly less compact.
