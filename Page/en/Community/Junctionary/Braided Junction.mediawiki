The '''Braided Junction''' is a compact junction.

===Pros===
*Very compact
*Traffic jams are unlikely since tracks split before they merge.
*No loops.

===Cons===
*The slopes and the sharp turns make trains go slower.
*Signal distance is 7 tiles on straight track over the bridge.

===Variants===

Adding signals north and south of bridge instead of using path-based signaling will make the crossing get a 5 tile signal distance on the straight track. The crossing will be slightly less compact.
