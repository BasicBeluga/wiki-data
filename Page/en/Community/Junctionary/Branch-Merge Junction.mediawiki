[[Translation:en/Community/Junctionary/Branch-Merge Junction]]
'''The Branch-Merge Junction''' is a small improvement over the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Complex Star Junction]] (CRAB) junction. It branches right at the beginning of the junction and merges right at the end, allowing more trains into the junction at once while preventing deadlock; it uses tunnels instead of bridges so that maximum speed is not limited; it has less slopes per path (middle two left turn tracks do not need to climb slopes); and it also has a more direct path than the CRAB. Trains heading straight, turning right, or turning left all have dedicated tracks, which helps alleviate traffic.

This junction is built for speed at the cost of space.

'''Pros:'''
*Handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Traffic jams are unlikely.
*Trains don't have to loop around like they do in a cloverleaf.
*Tracks split before they merge, avoiding traffic problems.


'''Cons:'''
*Trains have to slow down to climb a slope.
*Takes up a large amount of space.
*Costly to build.
