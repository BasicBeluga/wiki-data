'''The Branch-Merge Junction''' is a small improvement over the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Complex Star Junction]]. It branches right at the beginning of the junction and merges right at the end, allowing more trains into the junction at once while preventing deadlock; it uses tunnels instead of bridges so that maximum speed is not limited; it has less slopes per path (middle two left turn tracks do not need to climb slopes); and it also has a more direct path. Trains heading straight, turning right, or turning left all have dedicated tracks, which helps alleviate traffic.

This junction is built for speed at the cost of space.
