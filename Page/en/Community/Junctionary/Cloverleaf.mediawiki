It's best you make it so your longest train can fit completely into one of the turning tracks without blocking the main line behind it. Also note that [[en/Manual/Tunnels]] were used instead of [[en/Manual/Bridges]]. This is because trains have to slow down to the max speed of a bridge, but don't have to slow down with tunnels. This type of junction is good in the respect that it has a high capacity, but it's no good for hilly or cluttered areas because of the large amount of land it requires.

'''Pros:'''
*Can handle 4+ trains at a time.
*Traffic jams are unlikely.
 

'''Cons:'''
*Takes up a large amount of space.
*Trains turning right must loop around, covering the same square twice.
*Can cause gridlock
*Trains have to slow down to climb a slope and turn the corners.
*Trains must turn left to turn right. This could lead to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed by using [[en/Manual/Waypoints]])
