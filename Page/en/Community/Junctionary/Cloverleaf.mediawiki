[[Translation:en/Community/Junctionary/Cloverleaf]]
The size of the cloverleaf in the picture has been reduced to save download time. It's best you make it so your longest train can fit completely into one of the turning tracks without blocking the main line behind it. Also note that tunnels were used instead of bridges. This is because trains have to slow down to the max speed of a bridge, but don't have to slow down with tunnels. This type of junction is good in the respect that it has a high capacity, but it's no good for hilly or cluttered areas because of the large amount of land it requires.

'''Pros:'''
*Can handle a larger number of trains at a time.
*Traffic Jams are unlikely.
 

'''Cons:'''
*Trains have to slow down to climb a slope.
*Takes up a large amount of space.
*Trains must turn left to turn right. This could lead to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed by using [[en/Manual/Waypoints|checkpoints]])
*Trains turning right must loop around, covering the same square twice.
*Costly to build.
