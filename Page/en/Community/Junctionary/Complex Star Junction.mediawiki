[[Translation:en/Community/Junctionary/Complex Star Junction]]
Unlike the spaghetti or cloverleaf junctions, the tracks on the CRAB split before they merge so trains are less likely to encounter a red signal. Also, it does not give preference towards any track so it is great for where there are many trains coming from and going to all directions.

With a simple round-a-bout, there is only one looping track while with the complex version there are three. They each start in the centre and work their way outwards. Trains heading North East (where North is the top of the picture) from South East will go to the inside track. This then joins with the South West to North West track and becomes the middle track. Then finally it becomes the outside line after joining the North West to North East line and leaves the junction.

You can also use the CRAB on two-track lines, that is, a line with four tracks going up and two tracks going down. Although it appears complex, I've yet to see a better anywhere-to-anywhere 4-way 4-track junction. If you know of one, don't hesitate to tell me and the world about it. This is the newest of the 4-way junctions here. I've only used it once and never seen it used before. The biggest problem is when the loops merge with each other. In many cases you'd be better off having 2 3-Way Junctions, but it's up to you.

'''Pros:'''
*Handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Traffic Jams are unlikely.
*Trains don't have to loop around like they do in a cloverleaf.
*Tracks split before they merge, avoiding traffic problems.


'''Cons:'''
*Trains have to slow down to climb a slope.
*Takes up a large amount of space.
*Costly to build.
*Indirect path.
