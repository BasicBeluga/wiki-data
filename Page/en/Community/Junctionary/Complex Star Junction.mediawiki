{{en/Community/Junctionary/Navigation}}
This junction was originally mislabeled as a '''Complex Roundabout''', or CRAB, even though there is no roundabout loop.  The tracks on split before they merge so trains are less likely to encounter a red signal. It does not give preference towards any track.

It is a complicated version of the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Star Junction]], with the branches very long and intertwined.  A larger Star junction will have the same effect.

'''Pros:'''
*Handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Traffic Jams are unlikely.
*Trains don't have to loop around like they do in a cloverleaf.
*Tracks split before they merge, avoiding traffic problems.

'''Cons:'''
*Trains have to slow down to climb a slope.
*Takes up a huge amount of space.
*Costly to build.
*Indirect path.
*Larger trains slow down due to hard twist and turns.
