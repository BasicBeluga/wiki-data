'''The Crossover-Junction''' Is a junction designed with in mind a small junction which could handle a medium amount of traffic. It can be simply build over a mainline without changing to much to it. Only 4 connections to the mainline are made and the other lin stops. To fix this two bridges are built over the original mainline and connected to the other line. A little further two bridges over the new line are made and connected to make trains turn when they made a wrong turn.

'''Pros:'''
* Can handle a few trains.
* Doesn't take the train much time to clear.
* Not very difficult to remember.
* Relatively small.

'''Cons:'''
* It is well possible a train needs to go up a bridge twice.
* It can be quite expensive.
* Many tight turns, depending on how large the junction is built.  Train speeds are restricted on the best part of the junction when it is built as small as the example above.
* Trains slow down when they go over bridges.
