'''The Crossover-Junction''' Is a junction designed with in mind a small junction which could handle a medium amount of traffic. It can be simply build over a mainline without changing to much to it. Only 4 connections to the mainline are made and the other lin stops. To fix this two bridges are built over the original mainline and connected to the other line. A little further two bridges over the new line are made and connected to make trains turn when they made a wrong turn.
