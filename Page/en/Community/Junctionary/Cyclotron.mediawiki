A ''Cyclotron'' is a priority merge with a loop, so a train can wait at full speed for an opportunity to join a high-speed line.

According to the edition history of [[en/Community/Railway Designs]], the first design was proposed by [[en/Pitt2]] as follows:

    "Consider a sideline that loops back on itself after a failed priority merge. A train in this loop would continue to re-test the mainline for entry conditions, once every 8 * '''TL'' tiles until it found a space large enough to merge with the main line. After the cyclotron was empty, the next waiting train could pre-accelerate and be injected into the cyclotron, ready to continue the cycle. This system has some flaws, however, as it has a capacity of one train and there will be many missed opportunities due to the train being in the wrong position in the accelerator. Junctions are a large and well-trodden area of openttd; I have restricted myself to unbranched feeder structures. You will find that a highly-optimised stream of trains does NOT weather a junction well."

The design actually includes two trains in the loop, thus increasing the chance to find a slot on the high-speed line.

==Enhancements==

* Smaller cyclotrons increase the chance to find a slot on the high-speed line.
* One should not allow a train to enter a cyclotron while not at full speed. Injecting a slow train on a high-speed line would cause a traffic jam.

Refinements on those two points lead to the following design:

The size of the loop is tailored to the train size.
