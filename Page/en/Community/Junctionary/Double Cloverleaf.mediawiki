==Double Cloverleaf 4 way junction==

The Double Cloverleaf is an extended version of a normal '''[[en/Community/Junctionary/Cloverleaf]]''' junction.
This junction use tunnels instead of bridges because tunnels does'nt have speedlimits and you can place signals on top of tunnels. (not possible below bridges)
As you can see on the image below there are two tracks leading into the junction and two leading out and the whole reason for a double cloverleaf is if you have a 4 track mainline to allow more traffic to flow through your line.

'''PROS:'''
* Can handle a large number of trains at the same time.
* Uses separate tracks so trains wont interfere with eachother too mutch.
* Traffic jams are unlikely


'''CONS:'''
* Extremely large
* Trains have to slow down when climbing a slope
* Trains have to turn right to turn left. This could lead to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed using '''[[en/Manual/Waypoints]]''')
* Does'nt have a direct path so that trains travel extra far to turn left.
* Costly to build
* Difficult layout to remember and to build
