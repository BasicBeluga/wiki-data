The '''Double Cloverleaf''' is an extended version of a normal '''[[en/Community/Junctionary/Cloverleaf]]''' junction.
This junction use tunnels instead of bridges, because tunnels don't have speed limits, and you can place signals on top of tunnels (unlike below bridges).
As you can see on the image below, there are two tracks leading into the junction and two leading out: the whole reason for a double cloverleaf is to allow more traffic to flow through your line if you have a 4 track mainline.

===Pros===
* Can handle a large number of trains at the same time.
* Uses separate tracks so trains wont interfere with each other too much.

===Cons===
* Branching after merging: Very likely to enter a deadlock state.
* Extremely large
* Trains have to slow down when climbing a slope
* Trains have to turn right to turn left. This could lead to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed using '''[[en/Manual/Waypoints]]''')
* Doesn't have a direct path so that trains travel extra far to turn left.
* Costly to build
* Difficult layout to remember and to build
