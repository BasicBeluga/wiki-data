The '''Dual Tetrathorp Junction''' is a [[en/Community/Junctionary/Tetrathorp-Junction]] for double mainlines. It is ideally suited for mainlines at different height levels (in the following referred to as "Diff-Lev-Mains").

==Pros==
Putthrough:
* Tracks split before they merge.
* avoiding deadlocks.
* Can handle many trains at a time.
* Traffic jams are unlikely.

Speed:
* Turning trains need to take a maximum of one slope up and one slope down (on "Diff-Lev-Mains" they only need to go up OR down one slope).
* No Bridges, no sharp [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#vehicle-speeds|bends]], allowing 132km/h everywhere.
* On "Diff-Lev-Mains", both mainlines have no slopes (in the "original" variation).
* Trains don't have to loop around like they do in a [[en/Community/Junctionary/Double Cloverleaf|double cloverleaf]].

Special Features:
* Turning lanes are natural (To turn left trains just turn left), making [[en/Manual/Waypoints]] unnecessary.
* Turning lanes merge each other first and have a build-in load balancer before they merge the main line, allowing trains to go from inner lanes to outer lanes and vice versa, so that they can pick the new mainline with less traffic.
* Modular design: You can build the inner lanes first, with only little more space than the single [[en/Community/Junctionary/Tetrathorp-Junction]] and add the outer lanes later.

Building:
* Clearly structurated, therefore probably easier to remember and to build than for example the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Dual Branch-Merge Junction|dual Branch-Merge]].

==Cons==
Puttrough:
* 10 6-long tunnels and 8 5-long tunnels. (These could be split to tunnels with a maximum length of 4 tiles by expanding the whole junction a bit. Alternatively one can build all tunnels as [[en/Community/Junctionary/Dual tunnels|dual tunnels]].)

Speed:
* On "Same-Lev-Mains", most Trains have to go up and down slopes, even on one pair of mainlines. This is inevitable for split-before-merge junctions.

Special Features:
* Requires the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|building on slopes]] patch to be enabled.

Building:
* Needs as much space as the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Dual Branch-Merge Junction|dual Branch-Merge]], costs about 330k Pounds.
* Probably harder to remember than for example the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Double Cloverleaf|double cloverleaf]].

==Tips==
* Start building the inner single Tetrathorp (check if it works) then expand the junction outward.
* The outer lanes for turning right can easily be made longer, so that they can hold your longest train.

==Variations==
[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/Dual Ttj flat.png|none|thumb|600px|Dual Tetrathorp for flat terrain]]
This Dual Tetrathorp junction is optimized to be slightly more compact in flat terrain.
[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/Dual Ttj part.png|none|thumb|600px|Inner part of the Dual Tetrathorp]]
This is the inner single Terathorp (which is the same for the original junction and the flat variation). The outer landscaping is for the flat variation.
[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/Dual Ttj exits.png|none|frame|Improved exits for the Dual Tetrathorp Junction]]
The load balancers of the above variations can be improved like this. The zigzagging exits at the end imply a pathfinding penalty for trains, which otherwise could decide to cross the whole load balancer even if their neighboring mainline is free. Additionally the outer right-turning-lane (2) and the mainlines (1 and 3) have direct access or a shorter accelerating distance to the merging block than the other turning lanes (4). So trains waiting on these lanes (which are more probable to blocking other trains) get priority. (Priority is not to be confused with right-of-way, which is applied at the end of the load balancer).

Furthermore it is possible to make all curves longer to allow for higher speeds and to build some or all tunnels as [[en/Community/Junctionary/Dual tunnels|dual tunnels]] to improve the throughput. The load balancers can probably also be improved further.

==Technical Data==
* 40 free squares inside the junction
* 38 tunnels
Cost of the flat variation:
* Landscaping: 59.592 Pounds
* Inner Tetrathorp: 134.138 Pounds
* Outer Tetrathorp: 132.462 Pounds
* Total: 326.984 Pounds
