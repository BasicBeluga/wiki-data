The '''Dual Transmogrified Junction''' is a variation of [[en/Community/Junctionary/Transmogrified]] junction for double mainlines. This junction doubles the number of "junction squares" (the distinguishing feature of Transmogrified junction) to 4 and makes use of both bridges and tunnels to make it more compact.
