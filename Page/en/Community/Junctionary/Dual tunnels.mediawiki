Sometimes you need to build long [[en/Manual/Tunnels]]s on your mainline.  Tunnels do not have signals, so only one train can be inside at a time.  This can cause traffic slowdown or jams on your main line.

Adding additional tunnels solves this problem.  If one tunnel has a train in it when another train arrives, the 2nd train can continue through the 2nd tunnel instead of stopping.
