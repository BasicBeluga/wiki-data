== Half Cloverleaf ==

The half cloverleaf is, as its name suggests, half a cloverleaf. It can handle a reasonable amount of traffic, but there are [[en/Community/Junctionary/Ultimate 3-way junction|better options]].

'''Pros'''

*Can handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Traffic jams less likely.


'''Cons'''

*Costs more to build
*Trains must slow down to climb a slope.
*Trains must turn left to go right. This could lead to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed by using [[en/Manual/Waypoints|waypoints]]).
*Trains exit the main line before leaving. This could cause traffic problems.
*Not for larger trains due to great slowdowns from sharp turns in the design.

== Modified Half Cloverleaf ==

A slightly modified and optimised version of the half cloverleaf above.

'''Pros'''
*Can handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Traffic jams less likely than a regular half-cloverleaf, because the exits from main line are before entrances.
*Takes lesser amount of space vs Half Cloverleaf

'''Cons'''
*Trains must slow down to climb a slope.
*Costs a little to build.

'''Tips'''
*Make the distance between entrances and exits the length of your longest trains, plus two squares for signals. This way trains that are waiting at a red signal aren't preventing trains behind it from going down a different track.
