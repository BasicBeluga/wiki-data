The half cloverleaf is, as its name suggests, half of a [[en/Community/Junctionary/Cloverleaf]].  Trains have to do some looping.

===плюсы===
*Может обрабатывать большое количество поездов.
*пробки маловероятны.

===минусы===
*Поезда должны замедлиться, чтобы подняться на склон.
*Trains join the main line before leaving. This could cause traffic problems.
*Trains must turn left to go right. This could lead to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed by using [[en/Manual/Waypoints|waypoints]]). This is no longer an issue with newer OpenTTD versions that use a more advanced pathfinder.

===советы===
*Сделайте больше петель и без резких поворотов.
*Make one of the loops go the other direction, so the train doesn't have to loop around.
*Make the branches bigger to hold a complete train, so trains that are waiting at a red signal aren't blocking other trains.
