'''Pros:'''

*Can handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Traffic jams less likely.


'''Cons:'''

*Costs more to build
*Trains must slow down to climb a slope.
*Trains must turn left to turn right. This could lead to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed by using [[en/Manual/Waypoints|waypoints]]).
*Trains exit the main line before leaving. This could cause traffic problems.
