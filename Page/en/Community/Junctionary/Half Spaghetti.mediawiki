===Pros===
*Can handle a large number of trains at a time. 
*Traffic Jams are unlikely. 
*Straight main line.
*Trains don't have to loop around like they do in a half cloverleaf. 

===Cons===
*Costs and space more to build.
*Trains must slow down to climb a slope. 
*Trains must turn left to turn right. This could lead to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed by using [[en/Manual/Waypoints|waypoints]])
*Long trains can slow trains on primary route. The speed of trains on slope rapidly decreases. If deviated line is inadequate the end of train is stil on primary route. (Can be fixed by using [[en/Manual/Waypoints|waypoints]]).

===Tips===
*It's best you make it so your longest train can fit completely into one of the turning tracks without blocking the main line behind it.
