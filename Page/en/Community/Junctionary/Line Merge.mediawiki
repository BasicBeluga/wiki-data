[[Translation:en/Community/Junctionary/Line Merge]]
This type of junction is only good for lines where you want trains to go one direction only, from a raw material industry to a production industry or a final industry, for example from a Iron Ore Mine to a Steel Mill or from a Coal Mine to a Power Station. Note that a tunnel was used instead of a bridge. This is because tunnels have no maximum speed. Speed is everything so if you have to build a bridge, build the fastest one you can.
