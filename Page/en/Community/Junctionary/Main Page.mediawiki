'''Junctions''' are formed at any point where a piece of track directly crosses or joins another piece.  In practically all cases, signals are required in order to prevent trains crashing.  Junctions can range from very simple to very complex, depending on the number of tracks to be joined, the direction the trains are to travel and the number of trains expected to use the junction at any one time.
