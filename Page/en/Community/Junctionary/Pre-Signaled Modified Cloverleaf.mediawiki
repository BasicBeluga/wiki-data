[[Translation:en/Community/Junctionary/Pre-Signaled Modified Cloverleaf]]
This is a cloverleaf design as a three-way junction, with the possibility of doing U-turns. The screen shot shows an expanded 3-Way Cloverleaf, used on a high-traffic line. It can handle a high about of trains, but there are better options. It is best to make the distance of the loops the longest of your trains, plus two squares for the signals.

'''Pros:'''

*Can handle a very large number of trains at a time.
*Traffic jams less likely.


'''Cons:'''

*Very costly to build.
*Trains must slow down to climb a slope.
*Trains must turn left to turn right. This could lead to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed by using [[en/Manual/Waypoints|waypoints]]).
*Trains exit the main line before leaving. This could cause traffic problems.
*Not for larger trains due to great slowdowns from sharp turns in the design.
