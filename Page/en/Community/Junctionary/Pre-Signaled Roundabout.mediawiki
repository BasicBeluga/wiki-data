The Pre-Signaled Roundabout is a combination of ideas. The primary idea is the [[en/Manual/Building depots]] which uses signals to give priority to trains travelling on the main lines. The second idea is your basic [[en/Community/Junctionary/Roundabout]]. One of the flaws of the Roundabout is that it can only handle 2 trains at a time. This slightly larger version can handle 4 trains. Additionally, trains turning right do not need to enter the Roundabout, instead passing by on the outer paths. So even if 4 trains are in the inner loop, other trains can still make right turns. The second flaw in a Basic Roundabout is that there is no preference given to exiting trains or entering trains. Using the Presignal Hack First described in [[en/Manual/Building depots]], we are able to give preference to trains exiting the loop. This greatly reduces the chance of a traffic jam. (I'm pretty sure the only condition that will cause gridlock is four left turning trains entering the loop at exactly the same time.)

'''Pros:'''
*Trains can use the junction to make a U-turn.
*No hills.
*Smaller footprint than most 4 way junctions. 
*Cheaper than other 4 way junctions.
*Simple to start, complexity added later.
 
'''Cons:'''
*Gridlock possible.
*Large amount of larger trains cause traffic jams.
*Trains are still slowed by extra turns.
*Complex signals may be hard to get right.
