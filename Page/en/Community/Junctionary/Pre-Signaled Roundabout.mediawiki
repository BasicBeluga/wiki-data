The Pre-Signaled Round-A-Bout is a combination of Ideas. The primary idea is the [[en/Manual/Building depots]] which uses signals to give priority to trains travelling on the main lines. The second idea is your basic [[en/Community/Junctionary/Roundabout]]. One of the flaws of the Round-A-Bout is that it can only handle 2 trains at a time. This slightly larger version can handle 4 trains. Additionally, Trains turning Right do no need to enter the Round-A-Bout, instead passing by on the outer paths, So even if 4 trains are in the inner loop, other trains can still make right turns. The second flaw in a Basic Round-A-Bout is that there is no preference given to exiting trains or entering trains. Using the Presignal Hack First described in [[en/Manual/Building depots]], we are able to give preference to trains exiting the loop. This greatly reduces the chance of a trafic jam. (I'm pretty sure the only condition that will cause a jam is four left turning trains entering the loop at exactly the same time.)

An additional benefit is that this is a junction that can be built very simple to start with, and then built up. For example, you can star with a square version of the basic Round-A-Bout, and later on convert it into the Pre-Signaled version. This makes it very cheap to start with, and later when money is available the job can be completed.

'''Pros:'''
*Medium Capacity.
*Traffic Jams Unlikely.
*Trains can use the junction to make a U-turn.
*No Hills.
*Smaller Footprint than most 4 way junctions. 
*Cheaper than other 4 way junctions.
*Simple To Start, Complexity added Later.
 
'''Cons:'''
*Medium Capacity.
*Small chance of a traffic jam.
*Trains are still slowed by extra turns.
*Complex signals may be hard to get right.
