Quad Branch Merge Junction


I had a Dual Branch merge Junction in the center of my map just for kicks and it wasn't big enough after I got 150 or so trains on my map, so I was searching for something bigger and couldn't find anything.  After comparing the single branch merge and double branch merge I found a close enough ration to double the dual branch merge into a Quad Branch Merge.  It seems to be able to accommodate 10-15 trains at a time, but it is only a few days old.. so we'll see.  Any suggestions or modifications are very welcome I'd like it to be able to handle as many trains as possible as fast as possible.

I've modified the layout a little bit, eradicating 8 sharp corners making the trains run a little smoother.
That screen shot is of the OLD layout.  New screenshot to come after more stress testing of the layout.

The new layout is in the latest screenshot.  I've taken out 16 more sharp corners rerouting an initial entrance under some of the diagonal track to relieve some pressure and allow for faster transporting.  There are still 12 sharp corners I haven't been able to work around.
