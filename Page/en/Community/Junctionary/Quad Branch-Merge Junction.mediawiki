Quad Branch-Merge Junction


The Quad Branch-Merge Junction is the direct evolution of the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Branch-Merge Junction]] and [[en/Community/Junctionary/Dual Branch-Merge Junction]]; allowing four entrances and four exits, in essence doubling the appropriation power of a [[en/Community/Junctionary/Dual Branch-Merge Junction]].  Although still in it's infancy, the quad branch-merge junction is able to handle quite a load of [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Mammoth trains|large trains]] (20 cars) with very few backups.

Speculation of angled track in the [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build|nightly builds]] under existing bridges will allow at least a 50% increase in [[en/Manual/Trains|train]] [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Show vehicle speed|speed]]; eliminating eight turns that reduce train speed to below 100mph (161kph).  The sharpest turns are illustrated in [[File:en/Community/Junctionary/Sharpcorners.png|Figure B.]]
