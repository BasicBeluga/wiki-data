The Advanced Mainline Junction is a combination of ideas. The primary idea is the [[en/Manual/Building depots]] which uses signals to give priority to trains travelling on the main lines. The layout displayed gives trains travelling straight through the junction preferential treatment by causing merging trains to wait until the line is clear. The second idea is the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Roundabout]] which is generally considered a No-No. The main problem with a Round-A-Bout is that they can only have a few trains on them at once. The lowered areas of this junction create a Round-A-Bout with a diameter large enough to hold four full length trains. Addtionally, trains moving between the lower Round-A-Bout and the mainlines do so on the long track off the mainline into the inside of the Round-A-Bout, so that trains waiting to move onto the Round-A-Bout do not block the main line. Additionally, trains turning right have room to stop and not block the mainline if interrupted by a train coming out of the Round-A-Bout.

What is not displayed in the screenshot is in the test, there were 4 stations just off screen, and a total of 16 full length trains moving through. The stations got backed up before the junction got jammed. 

'''Pros:'''
*Very high capacity.
*Traffic jams unlikely.
*Minimal impact on trains travelling straight through.
*Trains can use the junction to make a U-turn.
 
'''Cons:'''
*Reqiures a large area.
*Trains may have to slow down to climb a slope.
*Costs more than other junctions.
*Turning Trains are slowed down by lots of turns.
*To be honest, I don't think I would actually use this junction. I just put it here to explore the idea, and perhaps give others an idea to work with.
