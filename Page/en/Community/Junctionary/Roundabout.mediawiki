<center>[[File:en/Big-two-to-four-roundabout.png|center|frame|Fig 2. Roundabout Second Version]]</center>

The second version of a roundabout has outer tracks that allows an inbound train to transfer to the next outbound track without entering the main inner roundabout track. This reduces the actual load on the roundabout.

It also has a signal between each inbound and outbound track. This means that trains can still exit on the outbound track if the inbound switch is not clear; and conversly that an inbound train can enter if the outbound switch is block.

'''Pros:'''
*Cheap/Easy to Build.
*Compact size.
*Can handle several trains at a time
*Trains don't have to slow down to climb a slope.
 
'''Cons:'''
*Medium capacity.
*Can quickly cause traffic-jams.

=Third Version=
<center>[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/No-colide-roundabout-4w.png|center|frame|Fig 3. Roundabout Third Version]]</center>

The third version of a roundabout introduces an easy way to handle traffic-jams. The image can handle 3 trains at a time and cannot cause any traffic-jams while there are no trains larger than 10. A train can enter if and only if there are no trains on the two next steps.

White signals define which trains have the priority:
* If signals are pointing to an entrance (like on the figure 3). Trains which will come in will have the priority.
* If signals are pointing to the roundabout. Trains which already are on the roundabout will have the priority.

To prevent traffic-jams all white signals should points the same thing.


'''Pros:'''
*Cheap/Easy to Build.
*Can handle up to 3 ( = 4 - 1 ) trains at a time
*Trains don't have to slow down to climb a slope.
 
'''Cons:'''
*Limited capacity.
*Can cause traffic-jams for trains larger than the distance beween two normal signals.
