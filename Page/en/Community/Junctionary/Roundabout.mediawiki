<center>[[File:en/Big-two-to-four-roundabout.png|center|frame|Fig 2. Roundabout Second Version]]</center>

The second version of a roundabout has outer tracks that allows an inbound train to transfer to the next outbound track without entering the main inner roundabout track. This reduces the actual load on the roundabout.

It also has a signal between each inbound and outbound track. This means that trains can still exit on the outbound track if the inbound switch is not clear; and conversly that an inbound train can enter if the outbound switch is block.

'''Pros:'''
*Cheap/Easy to Build.
*Compact size.
*Can handle several trains at a time
*Trains don't have to slow down to climb a slope.
 
'''Cons:'''
*Medium capacity.
*Can quickly cause traffic-jams.
