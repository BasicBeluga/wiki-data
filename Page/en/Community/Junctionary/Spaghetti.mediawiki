As with the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Cloverleaf]], this junction has been reduced in size to save download time. It's best you make it so your longest train can fit completely into one of the turning tracks without blocking the main line behind it.

'''Pros:'''
*Handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Traffic Jams are unlikely.
*Trains don't have to loop around like they do in a cloverleaf.


'''Cons:'''
*Trains have to slow down to climb a slope.
*Takes up a large amount of space.
*Trains must turn left to turn right. This could lead to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed by using [[en/Manual/Waypoints|waypoints]])
*Costly to build.
*Indirect path.
*Trains merge before they split in one axis.
