The '''Spaghetti Junction''' is a step up from the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Cloverleaf]].  It is more complicated and expensive, but smaller and with more exits before merges.

===Pros===
*Handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Traffic Jams are unlikely.
*Trains don't have to loop around like they do in a cloverleaf.
*Functions as a U in 2 of the 4 primary directions.

===Cons===
*Trains have to slow down to climb a slope.
*Takes up a large amount of space.
*Trains must turn left to turn right. This could lead to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed by using [[en/Manual/Waypoints]])
*Costly to build.
*Indirect path.
*Trains merge before they split in one axis.

===Tips===
*Make it so your longest train can fit completely into one of the turning tracks without blocking the main line behind it.

===Variations===
