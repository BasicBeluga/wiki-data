The '''Star Junction''' is arguably the best known 4-way junction.  All merges occur after all exits (no gridlock), all directions are treated equally, it is small with no sharp turns, and is fairly simple to build.

===Pros===
*Handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Paths split before they merge.
*Won't cause traffic jams.
*Not difficult to build
*Small compared to other bridged 4-way junctions.

===Cons===
*Some branches are shorter than others, which may cause some trains to wait unnecessarily.
*Can take up a lot of space.

===Tips===
*Start by building the bridges or tunnels.
*Resize to make each branch long enough to hold a complete train.
*Make it smaller. You can save one square under the bridges.
*Use a combination of bridges and tunnels to keep bridge/tunnel length to three tiles (including bridgeheads or entrances)
