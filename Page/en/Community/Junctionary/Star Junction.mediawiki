*Handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Some branches are shorter than others, which may cause some trains to wait unnecessarily.
'''Tips'''
*Start by building the bridges or tunnels.
*Resize to make each branch long enough to hold a complete train.
*Make it smaller. You can save one square under the bridges.
*Use a combination of bridges and tunnels to keep bridge/tunnel length to three tiles (including bridgeheads or entrances)
*Area: 14 x 14

This variation is compact but not especially fast. There are no right-angle turns but left turns are [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#trains|one-tile double bends]] limited to 55 MPH (88 km/h), as in most less-complex junctions. It is intended to carry a heavy load of [[en/Industrial service|industrial]] trains with great variation in train lengths. 

This is a right-hand-running image with signals on the drive side. All signals are standard path except for a single one-way path at each entry. The signaling shown hustles trains through closely, without regard for the possibility of blocking other trains; a more conservative scheme would have fewer signals inside the junction, or none. A combo or block scheme is also possible. 

A sufficiently long train (about 11 tiles), making a left-hand turn from, say, the NW-bound main to the SW-bound, that breaks down just after it reserves its exit to the main; can block all traffic NW and SW straight, SE to SW, NW to NE, and of course trains following NW to SW. That is 5 of the possible 12 routes through the junction, the maximum disruption. Shorter trains are able to block fewer routes. Of course, a blocked train may block others, aggravating any jam. Deadlocks, in which a train blocks its own exit or two or more trains block one another's exits, are impossible. 

This image reveals the areas underneath the bridges.
