{{en/Community/Junctionary/Junction Criteria|Moderate|2|2|2|0|1|1|0|1|0|0|0||Broken down trains only affect the one track.|
*Handle a large number of trains at a time.
*Some branches are shorter than others, which may cause some trains to wait unnecessarily.
'''Tips'''
*Start by building the bridges or tunnels.
*Resize to make each branch long enough to hold a complete train.
*Make it smaller. You can save one square under the bridges.
*Use a combination of bridges and tunnels to keep bridge/tunnel length to three tiles (including bridgeheads or entrances)
*Area: 14 x 14
