A '''Tetrathorp Junction''' is a normalized [[en/Community/Junctionary/Cloverleaf]] -- that is, the loops have been reversed and made more natural (if you want to turn left you just turn left).  There are several possible tetrathorp designs, but they all have the same basic benefits:

* They can handle many trains at a time.
* Traffic jams are unlikely.
* Trains don't have to loop around like they do in a cloverleaf.
* Tracks split before they merge, avoiding traffic problems.

= Original Tetrathorp =

This is the original tetrathorp design.  It's easy to remember and implement, but the use of bridges, slopes and sharp turns make it less efficient than other designs.

Early in the game, trains have to slow down to climb slopes because of their lack of horse power.  Later in the game, trains have to slow down because bridges have speed limits.

= Tunnelled Tetrathorp =

In this design, bridges are replaced with tunnels, and inner lines that branch from the main line merge with outer branch lines instead of directly merging back onto the main line.

This design removes the speed limits imposed by bridges, but still requires some trains to climb a slope twice while turning.

= Tetrathorp with Turning Lanes =

This design is more complex and costly than the above designs, and requires the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|building on slopes]] patch to be enabled.  However, it should give the best performance of any tetrathorp design.

The most obvious advantage here is that no path across this junction involves climbing more than one slope.  However, the use of turning lanes also minimises the knock-on effects of turning.  Trains turning sharp corners can only go at about 80% of their maximum speed, and in other designs, a turning train might force trains behind it to wait while it turns.  The use of dedicated turning lanes means that trains don't have to slow down while turning until after they've left the main line.

= Tetrathorp with tunnels and bridges =

Finally, this design tries to maximise the performance of early trains at the expense of later ones, without using the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|building on slopes]] patch.  Although bridges are used, trains passing through this junction will only have to travel over a maximum of one upward slope or one bridge.

Another benefit of this design is that, because tunnels and bridges are kept as short as possible, you can put signals in much nearer together, allowing trains to follow each other more closely.
