'''The Tetrathorp Junction''' is a, well, "normalized" cloverleaf -- that is, the loops were reversed and made more natural (if you want to turn left you just turn left). The idea is trivial, but it wasn't mentioned here before.

'''Pros:'''
*Handle some number of trains at a time.
*Traffic jams are unlikely.
*Trains don't have to loop around like they do in a cloverleaf.
*Tracks split before they merge, avoiding traffic problems.
*Doesn't take up too many space.
*Isn't very costly to build.
*Easy to remember and implement.


'''Cons:'''
*Trains have to slow down to climb a slope.
*Left-to-down and right-to-up directions take two bridges/tunnels to complete.

Another version of the same junction:
*uses tunnels instead of bridges for the four branch lines;
*branch lines merge with outer turn lines instead of the mainline itself.
