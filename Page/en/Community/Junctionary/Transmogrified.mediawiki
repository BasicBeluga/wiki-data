In a '''Transmogrified Junction''' the entrances from north and south are located on one level together with the exits to east and west, and vice versa on the other level. There is a 3-way version called a [[en/Community/Junctionary/Half Transmogrified]] junction.

==Pros==
* Quite fast.
* Quite compact.
* Traffic jams are unlikely since tracks split before they merge.
* No loops.

==Cons==
* There are slopes on the straight tracks and at least half the turning tracks.
* Looks like a swastika

==Variations==

With a larger central square 7 wagons may fit between the turns on the slow path.

[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/Ttd.transmogrified.compact.png|frame|none|Compact transmogrified junction]]

In this compact configuration the junction is very slow.

The incoming tracks are aligned with the outgoing.
