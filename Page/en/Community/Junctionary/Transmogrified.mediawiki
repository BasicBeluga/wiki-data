==Pros==
* Quite fast.
* Quite compact.
* Traffic jams are unlikely since tracks split before they merge.
* No loops.

==Cons==
* There are slopes on the straight tracks and on at least half the turning tracks.


==Variations==

With a larger central square 7 wagons may fit between the turns on the slow path.

In this compact configuration the junction is very slow.
