{{en/Community/Junctionary/Navigation}}

Similar to the [[en/Community/Junctionary/Half Transmogrified]] junction, but with tunnels instead of bridges and some tracks connect at different points.

===Pros===
*Traffic jams unlikely.
*Can handle a large number of trains at a time.
*There are no sharp turns, maximizing train speed.
*Average construction cost.

===Cons===
*Some trains must slow down to climb a slope on the main line.
*Difficult to build correctly on the first try.
*Larger area.
===Tips===
*Start by building the "short diagonal" track first.

==Minimal mainline <-> branch line 3 way non-intersecting junction==

Here's a slightly better mainline example:

[[File:en/Community/Junctionary/3way-over-under.jpeg|none|thumb|600px|3-way over-under]]

===Pros===
*No sharp turns (except in the bottom example - would require diagonal bridges or tunnels to improve)
*Minimum of tunnels/bridges
*Split before merge
*Small area
*Direct main line
*Natural turns
*Enough space for signals
*Can handle plenty of trains.

===Cons===
*No Priorities (Will slow the mainline)
