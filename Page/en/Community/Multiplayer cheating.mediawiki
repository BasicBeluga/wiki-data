'''Cheating In Multiplayer - Methods And How To Stay Safe'''

Cheating in OpenTTD can range from being annoying to ruining an entire game for all the players concerned. As I've had a lot of experience in this arena, I hope this document will bring out a smarter generation of Multiplayer servers that work hard to dissuade cheating.


'''The Cons'''

Mostly if you find yourself in hot water during a game, it's because of either of two factors (or both). The two things that go wrong are:

* Someone joins your company cause you didn't set a password. They then do stuff you don't like
* Someone has great wealth and lowers all the land / buys up exclusive transport rights to everything

I'm going to deal with these in two sections. The password issue first.

'''Always Set A Password'''

This is the easiest type of problem to avoid. Always, always set a password. If you want to encourage friends to help your company along, have them join a server as an observer, then IM them your password. Don't just leave your company open. Really, you have only yourself to blame. Also watch out that some servers reset your password if you're gone for more than a certain time period.


'''Great Wealth'''

Nothing can be done per se as to people who have great wealth, but there are ways you can prevent fraudulent amounts of wealth being collected in the first place. By far one of the easiest cons is share dealing. You buy up 75% of a company, give it all your money (you have two TT's open, one is you and the other is your second company) and then sell the shares for more than you paid for them. Then you send the money back, and keep doing that. It is feasible to make about Â£300,000,000 using this method in a few minutes. Potentially the revenue from it is limitless.


The prevention for this con ultimately should be that server admins should disable share trading in openttd.cfg. Share trading is a bad idea in multiplayer. It should just not be there.


If you are on a server that allows share dealing, you can take steps to prevent it becoming rampant. Companies must be a certain age before their shares can be traded. If you're done with your game, wind it down by selling the vehicles, and either give the money to other players or raise some land at the corner of the map, then sink it again, till your funds are exhausted. This way the company will soon go bankrupt. A deserted company may have it's password reset to blank, and it will be old. So it's a five minute job for someone to spot this company and use it as a bank company.
