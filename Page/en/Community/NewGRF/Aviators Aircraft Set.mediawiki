The '''Aviators Aircraft Set''', which was also known as '''Av8''', which is a play on the word '''Aviate''', is an [[en/Manual/Aircraft]] [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] set for [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]] and [[en/Manual/Main Page]] created by [[en/Archive/Community/Users/PikkaBird]]. 

There is a large range of planes from early propellor aircraft in 1920 to 2050, with larger planes like the A380. The set is renowned for utilising different graphics for taxiing, and takeoff and landing, giving a more realistic view on planes. It also uses a callback not yet utilised in OpenTTD which will slow planes down before landing.

The set, like the [[en/Community/NewGRF/UK Renewal Set]], uses new sounds. Unlike the UK Renewal Set, this does not include running sounds, but landing and take off sounds.

Unlike traditional drawing for TTD, the planes were created by creating full 3d models, which were then rendered and resized to TTD scale, in a similar manner to how graphics for the new graphics engine will be created, and how Locomotion's graphics were created.
