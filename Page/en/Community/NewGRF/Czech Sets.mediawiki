The community which has developed around server Tycoonez.com (99% Czech) is creating and subsequently releasing their own .grf sets. Those are GPL-licensed, mostly OpenTTD compatible and made to reassemble trains, vehicles and roads current or past on landscape of Czech Republic (and Slovakia, as these countries used to be one, known as Czechoslovakia). Work is currently slowly progressing, but you can use these sets.

Most notable set is CSDSet, a set of train engines, including some very famous trains (yet it is known that there is bug with EMU 608, known as Pendolino). This set is well usable with CSDCargoSet, a set of carriages (yet there are missing types - use of other set as DB is recommended). To be compete, we shall mention CSRailSet which changes graphic of railways and CSStationSet, a great work (!) of station buildings, with possibility of recreating real main railway stop in Prauge (the capital of Czech Republic). There are more unfinished sets working on different aspects of transportation in Czech Republic.

To be noted, there is also Tramway set, which can be used when playing OpenTTD nightly builds, where is Tramway support avalible.

These sets are partialy uncomplete, but worth trying.
