'''What does this patch do?'''

Daylength can be set from 1 to 31.
Where the value can be seen as a multiplier for the daylength, i.e. 2 doubles the length of a year from 13,5 real minutes to 27 minutes if your computer can run OpenTTD at normal speed.

- Server side setting so it can be used in multiplayer.

- Setting can be changed anytime during a game also during multiplayer with rcon command.

- Industry Production is not affected, which means that production numbers double with a daylength value of 2.

- Cargo payment rates are the same as before, which means you don't get extra money for taking less virtual time for transports.

- Vehicle running costs increase according to the daylength, which means a daylength of 2 makes vehicles twice as expensive per year to run. (This      setting was optional before and is now default behaviour)

[[File:en/Community/NewGRF/Nighttd.gif]]

This is just a Newgrf for OTTD day to night conversion but not the full day/night cycle

This set is a complete day to night conversion of all the map items, including terrains, industries, city buildings, vehicles, etc.

Note: This set should be used with a dark company color, and with highest priority on the TTDXC's GRF files list.
