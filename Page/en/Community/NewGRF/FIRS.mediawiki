'''FIRS Industry Replacement Set'''

FIRS is a newGRF providing new industries and cargos for OpenTTD. It introduces two new concepts; primary industries require regular deliveries of spare parts in order to grow, and secondary industries will increase their production whenever they get deliveries of two ''different'' cargoes within the same month. If you ignore these changes, you are at a significant disadvantage compared to how you would perform in the standard game, but by catering properly for these two important differences you can grow your company more reliably under FIRS than you can under the standard rules.

== Strategy Tips ==

=== Industry Growth ===

FIRS includes control parameters that allow you to determine whether or not primary and secondary industries shut down, or shrink if not supplied with spares. If you do turn on these parameters, you will find that primary industries will slowly shrink to nothing and shut down if you don't take steps to supply them in time. You do have several years' grace, but you can't neglect supplying your industries with engineering or farm supplies forever.

Over the years, typical production (for e.g. a scrap yard) might be something like 72&ndash;72&ndash;64&ndash;72&ndash;64&ndash;56&ndash;64&ndash;64&ndash;56 and so on; by the time average production has dropped by a full 'step', it's a good idea to have a machine shop linked in to your network, if you are running an 'engineering network' or a lumber yard if you are running a 'farming network'.

''Unserved'' industries will tick over for somewhat longer; this warning mostly applies to the places where you have built stations. Furthermore, industries won't grow until they have received regular arrivals of spare parts for at least a few months.

On easier difficulty settings, these concerns do still apply, but they are less pressing, because new industries appear at a greater rate, replacing the losses and increasing the odds that a new industry will pop up in a convenient spot to be cheaply linked in to your transport network.

=== Engineering Supplies ===

Terkhen: "do the steel chain first, send ENSP everywhere, get $$$." Call this approach an 'engineering network', as it relies on supplying mines and quarries with engineering supplies, and initially ignores the smaller but more numerous farms.

=== Farming Supplies ===

Farming supplies are easier to generate and will have many more customers on the map, so another course to consider is to produce farming supplies from a lime kiln or fertilizer plant and use a farm feeder system to spread these supplies about. Call this approach a 'farming network'. The greater numbers of farms on the map increases the odds that one of them will quickly increase production once it has received its spare parts. However, this setup requires greater initial spending on roads or rail lines, and may be too costly on harder difficulty settings. If you follow this route, it's important to connect a forest to a lumber yard reasonably quickly, otherwise the coal mines and quarries supplying your lime kiln &ndash; and hence chemicals to your fertilizer plant &ndash; will slowly degrade due to lack of spare parts. A similar concern applies if you use an oil wells/oil refinery route instead, because oil wells need engineering supplies too. Biorefineries, if available, are better to use; you can then run separate networks for farming industries (all supported with farming supplies) and mining industries (all supported with engineering supplies).

=== Supply Orders ===
 
The FIRS manual suggests using transfer orders to deliver engineering or farm supplies a few at a time in smaller vehicles. In fact, using such 'supply orders' effectively is probably the major gameplay difference between FIRS and standard OpenTTD.

A convenient way to manage your supply orders using trains and trucks is as shown:

[[File:fr/Community/NewGRF/ENSP feeder1.png|Truck station for feeding supplies to quarry (1x4 layout).]] [[File:fr/Community/NewGRF/ENSP feeder2.png|Truck station for feeding supplies to quarry (2x3 layout).]]

Usage is as follows:

# Set up an engineering supply train with a capacity of around 60&ndash;120 crates of engineering or farm supplies, as appropriate.
# Deliver these crates using 'Transfer and Leave Empty' orders.
# Set up a small low-capacity local supply truck.
# Refit the truck to deliver 1&ndash;4 crates of engineering/farm supplies at a time.
# Timetable the truck so that its total journey takes about 28 days.
# To keep the ratings for engineering/farm supplies high, the truck should spend most of its time waiting at the supply arrival station.

By doing this, you ensure that your initial consignment of 60&ndash;120 crates of supplies will be delivered at a rate of 1&ndash;4 crates a month, which means the station won't need to be resupplied for anything between one and ten years. The delivery truck won't be very profitable, but the increased production from the main industry will completely dwarf any minor losses you make.

Once all your stations have a good store of engineering supplies, switch the supply trains from 'Transfer and Leave Empty' orders to 'No Loading', and then you can profit from excess production without having to rejig a large number of vehicle orders.

Note that supply orders are useful in other areas of the game, too. See [[en/Community/NewGRF/FIRS#production-rates|Production Rates]], below.

'''Minor Tip''': If you build your stations immediately next to the industries they serve, try to have a one-square overlap next to the industry, so that you have a convenient 'corner' along which to line up the truck stations. [[File:fr/Community/NewGRF/Good and bad placement.png|center|Good and less good truck station placement.]] While placing Aberminster Mines truck station 'round the corner' from the main railway station doesn't do ''much'' harm, if you later wanted to extend the station length northwards, you'd be limited to 11 squares length. By contrast a station set up like Aberminster South could be extended to 12 squares in either direction without having to demolish and rebuild the truck station.

=== Farm Feeder Systems ===

Farms are good for setting up a feeder system. They provide raw materials like milk, and need farm supplies.
[[File:en/Community/NewGRF/Farm feeder.png|center|Feeder station to and from a number of farms.]]
Big trucks bring farm supplies to the feeder station, and get the milk from it.
Small cargo trucks distribute the supplies to all the farms, and small milk trucks drive around along all the farms collecting milk, until fully loaded. Then they bring the milk to the big milk truck at the feeder station.

=== Cargo Priorities ===

Which cargos to deliver first depends on the terrain layout and your personal preferences, but here are some factors to consider:

Oil wells have the largest initial production of any industry. That means even if their production does drop over time, they'll last the longest before shutting down. If you see an oil refinery with a machine shop nearby, an oil-petrol-ENSP line is just as good an initial chain to set up as the steel or aluminium chain.

Coal and iron ore mines are the next most prolific, while junk yards are the least. Most farming-type industries are equal, generally producing about 18 tonnes of two cargos. The exceptions are forests, which start out at iron ore mine levels of production, and fishing grounds, which are about half that production level, but tend to be very numerous.

Fishing grounds are individually modest producers, but there are lots of them and they can't receive any maintenance even if you wanted to send them some. The limiting factor on exploiting fishing grounds tends to be the comparative rarity of fishing harbours, and their sometimes strange placement &ndash; e.g. in isolated lakes without fishing grounds. If you do encounter a well-placed harbour, it may be worth at least running it at maintenance level until you can build a fishing fleet. The best way to use ships with FIRS is generally to use straight-line ship-to-shore routes and then transfer the cargo onto faster trains for transport to the often distant fishing harbours.

Do keep an eye out for oil wells, dredging sites and fishing grounds close enough to shore to be within the catchment area of an on-shore station. Delivering engineering supplies becomes much easier in such cases as well. You can let the industry transport its production to shore in its own (invisible) vessels; you may not even need to provide a dock.

[[File:en/Community/NewGRF/No fleet needed.png|center|No fleet needed here!]]

=== Production Rates ===

The production rates of FIRS' secondary industries are affected by the number of different supplies in the same month. For example, a lime kiln supplied with 100 tonnes of stone will generate 50 tonnes of output; 25 tonnes of farming supplies and 25 tonnes of chemicals. Allowing for a 50&ndash;75% station rating, that will probably generate between 12 and 20 tonnes each of chemicals and farming supplies for you to deliver. This means you may want to size your outgoing delivery trains as small as 10&ndash;40% of the inbound supply trains. There is a compromise level to be chosen so that you transport reasonable amounts of secondary supplies reasonably quickly, without waiting too many months for an over-large delivery train to fill up.

If both primary resources are supplied in the same month, production increases. 50 tonnes of coal plus 50 tonnes of stone to the same lime kiln would produce 50 tonnes each of farming supplies and chemicals; twice as much. Allowing for the station rating, you will then have perhaps 25&ndash;40 tonnes of each cargo type to deliver, and you can then double the size of your delivery trains. In fact, any mix of coal and stone would produce a similar production increase, even 99 of one and only one tonne of the other. (n.b. Last sentence TBC &ndash; Simons_Mith).

Hence this is another case where supply orders become useful; deliver 100 tonnes of coal and stone using a transfer order, then supply them to the lime kiln a tonne each a month, in just the same way as you might handle engineering supplies to a mine. Whenever your larger deliveries of coal or stone arrive, even if they don't appear in the same calendar month as one another, they will still qualify for the increased production rate. Once the kiln gets very busy, and you can be certain that both cargo types will always arrive within the same month, you can cancel the supply order as no longer needed.

Some industries &ndash; including steel mills and aluminium plants &ndash; accept ''three'' different delivery types. Delivering any two of the three within the same month generates the maximum production. (n.b. Also TBC &ndash; Simons_Mith) Some secondary industries benefit more from the arrival of some parts than others. Again, steel mills and aluminium plants are affected by this; in both cases, one tonne of scrap metal is as good as two tonnes of the industries' other supplies (iron ore, coal, bauxite or chemicals). This is mostly counterbalanced by the fact that scrapyards are initially half as productive as mines. However, that in turn means that growing a scrapyard by bringing it engineering supplies brings twice the benefit.

=== Founding New Industries ===

Even when the game settings permit it, founding new industries is usually ruinously expensive, but there are three exceptions: Stores, Petrol Stations and Builders' Yards are much, much cheaper than the average. Bear in mind that whenever you want to sell on goods, petrol, food, alcohol or building materials, if you can found your own industries you can create a ready-made recipient for these materials at a place of your choosing.
