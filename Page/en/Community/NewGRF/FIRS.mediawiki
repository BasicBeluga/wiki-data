== Strategy Tips ==

=== Engineering and Farming Supplies ===

Terkhen: "do the steel chain first, send ENSP everywhere, get $$$"

FIRS includes control parameters that allow you to decide whether or not primary and secondary industries shrink if not supplied with spares. If you do use very high difficulty settings, you may even find an industry slowly shrinks to nothing and shuts down if you don't take steps to supply it in time. You do have several years' grace, but you can't neglect supplying your industries with engineering or farm supplies forever. Furthermore, on harder difficulty settings, the industry won't grow until it has received regular arrivals of spare parts for at least a few months.

On easier difficulty settings, these concerns do still apply, but they are far less pressing.

The FIRS manual suggests using transfer orders to deliver supplies a few at a time in smaller vehicles. A convenient way to manage this using trains and trucks is as shown:

[[File:fr/Community/NewGRF/ENSP feeder1.png|Truck station for feeding supplies to quarry (1x4 layout).]] [[File:fr/Community/NewGRF/ENSP feeder2.png|Truck station for feeding supplies to quarry (2x3 layout).]]

Usage is as follows:

# Set up an engineering supply train with a capacity of around 60-120 crates of engineering or farm supplies, as appropriate.
# Deliver these crates using 'Transfer and Leave Empty' orders.
# Set up a small low-capacity local supply truck.
# Refit the truck to deliver 1&ndash;4 crates of Engineering/Farm Supplies at a time.
# Give the truck orders to visit the main station, collect supplies, deliver to the truck-only station, then go to the depot.
# Timetable the truck so that:
## its total journey takes about 28 days, and
## it spends most of that time stationary in the depot.

By doing this, you ensure that your initial consignment of 60-120 crates of supplies will be delivered at a rate of 1&ndash;4 crates a month, which means the station won't need to be resupplied for anything between one and ten years. The delivery truck won't be very profitable, but the increased production from the main industry will completely dwarf any minor losses you make.

Once all your stations have a good store of engineering supplies, switch the supply trains from 'Transfer and Leave Empty' orders to 'No Loading', and then you can profit from excess production without having to rejig a large number of vehicle orders.

'''Minor Tip''': When you build stations, try to have a one-square overlap next to the industry, so that you have a convenient 'corner' along which to line up the truck depots. [[File:fr/Community/NewGRF/Good and bad placement.png|center|Good and less good truck station placement.]] While placing Aberminster Mines truck depot 'round the corner' from the main railway station doesn't do ''much'' harm, if you later wanted to extend the station length northwards, you'd be limited to 11 squares length. By contrast Aberminster South can be extended to 12 squares in either direction without having to demolish and rebuild the truck station.

=== Farm Feeder Systems ===

Farms are good for setting up a feeder system. They provide raw materials like milk, and need farm supplies.
[[File:en/Community/NewGRF/Farm feeder.png|center|Feeder station to and from a number of farms.]]
Big trucks bring farm supplies to the feeder station, and get the milk from it.
Small cargo trucks distribute the supplies to all the farms, and small milk trucks drive around along all the farms collecting milk, until fully loaded. Then they bring the milk to the big milk truck at the feeder station.
