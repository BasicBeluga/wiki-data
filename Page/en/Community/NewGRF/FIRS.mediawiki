'''Strategy Tips'''

Terkhen: "do the steel chain first, send ENSP everywhere, get $$$"



Farms are good for setting up a feeder system. They provide raw materials like milk, and need farm supplies.

Big trucks bring farm supplies to the feeder station, and get the milk from it.
Small cargo trucks distribute the supplies to all the farms, and small milk trucks drive around along all the farms collecting milk, until fully loaded. Then they bring the milk to the big milk truck at the feeder station.
