As of OpenTTD 1.2.0, the method of supplying 32 bit graphics to the game has changed. From this point forward, 32 bit graphics are supplied via [[en/Manual/NewGRF]]s. At the moment, not all existing 32 bit graphics are available in NewGRF format. This page lists the currently available 32 bit graphics for OpenTTD 1.2.0 and newer.
