The '''UK Renewal Set''' or '''UKRS''' is a set drawn and coded by Pikkabird (with some vehicles by DanMack) that re-introduces improved UK trains into [[en/Manual/Main Page]] or [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]]. It uses some complicated [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] features, yet is almost 100% compatible with OpenTTD. The set uses newsounds, but as newsounds are not yet supported in OpenTTD, they will not yet be heard.

It is most probably the most popular Graphic Set in use with OpenTTD due to this and its wide selection of vehicles. Wagons come in different generations, starting with slow, low capacity wagons, and ending with large capacity, fast wagons.
