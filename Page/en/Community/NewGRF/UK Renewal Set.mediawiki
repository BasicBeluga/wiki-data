The '''UK Renewal Set''' or '''UKRS''' is a set drawn and coded by Pikkabird (with some vehicles by DanMack) that re-introduces improved UK trains into [[en/Manual/Main Page]] or [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]]. It uses some complicated [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] features, yet is almost 100% compatible with OpenTTD. The set uses newsounds, but as newsounds are not yet supported in OpenTTD, they will not yet be heard.

It is most probably the most popular Graphic Set in use with OpenTTD due to this and its wide selection of vehicles. Wagons come in different generations, starting with slow, low capacity wagons, and ending with large capacity, fast wagons.

Some features include:
*Steam locomotives with tenders.
*Locomotives with differing liveries.
*Different generations of wagons, from 2 axle wagons to long, bogey wagons.
*Running sounds and horn/whistle sounds (Feature does not yet work in OTTD)
*Dual Company Colour liveries.
*Works with AI

There are 12 steam engines, 15 Diesel Engines (including DMU), 7 electric engines, and 8 futuristic engines, the last available in 2039, and is available for conventional rail. The above features which do no yet work in OTTD have their support being developed. Proof of this is that the 2cc.grf is shipped with OTTD in preparation of dual company colours.
