Drive-through depots are depots that have a door in both sides. A train or road vehicle can enter and leave from either side. This allows build of space-efficient sidings, service areas, etc.

== Current patch ==

* [http://cataclysm.cx/random/openttd/drive-through-depots.r15839.diff drive-through-depots.r15839.diff] (against r15839)

== Features ==

* Enter/leave road and rail depots from front and back sides
* Leaving depot triggers "leave station" codepaths, ie determine path to next order and reverse/don't reverse as necessary. If no path found or no next order, vehicle leaves as it entered, just like regular depots
* Two vehicles can enter/leave depot from opposite sides at the same time without collisions
* Building a depot will also build junction rails/roads on both sides as required

== Todo ==

* Be more deliberate about allowing pathfinder to find a path through the depot, with some explicit cost
* Make it so that there can only be one train on the depot tile at a time, with pseudo-signals to stop entering
** It currently looks really ugly when two trains are entering/leaving at the same time as they draw on top of each other
* Allow vehicles to drive through without stopping
** Enabled via an advanced option
** Incurs a speed penalty
* Expose drive-through depots to AIs

=== To be considered ===

* Are single-entry depots required anymore?
** If you only want to use one side, just don't hook up the other side.
** On the other hand, a front-side door to nowhere looks silly
** Also potential frustration with the autotrack/road stuff if you didn't want to join the depot to one side
* Are new graphics required?
