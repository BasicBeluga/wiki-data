Support for Passenger and cargo destinations in OpenTTD exists in the new cargo packets branch by [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Celestar]] and [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Peter1138]].

== Code ==

Available via [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/ mercurial]:
* [http://arwen.fvfischer.de:8000/ Celestar]


So for example:

    hg clone http://arwen.fvfischer.de:8000/ cargodest-celestar

== Dependencies ==

In addition to the normal libraries and such that OpenTTD trunk requires, you will need the development headers/libraries for [http://www.boost.org/ Boost] - specifically, the Boost Graph library. Both versions 1.34 and 1.35 should work.

Under debian/ubuntu, this is provided via the libboost-graph-dev package, which also depends on the various other required portions of Boost.

So for example:

    sudo aptitude install libboost-graph-dev
