Support for Passenger and cargo destinations in OpenTTD exists in the new cargo packets branch by [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Celestar]] and [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Peter1138]].

== Overview ==
''Cargodest'' is a system where cargo decides where it wishes to go and not the player (by sending vehicles somewhere). This greatly increases the challenge and detail of the game and frankly, it's more fun and realistic as well. There have been a number of attempts at integrating this feature into OpenTTD and we're nearly there meanwhile. This page deals with some of the technical and gameplay details of ''cargodest'' and provides a short manual on how to use it.

{{en/Warning|Savegames which are created with this branch might no longer work in subsequent versions. They will for sure not work in trunk, even after cargodest has been merged into trunk<br>Also, please bear in mind that not all trunk games, especially the latest ones, do not work}}

{{en/Note|Please bear in mind that this is a feature which might not yet be stable. Read this page carefully because it shows what might work and what doesn't}}

== Terms ==
''Route Network'' is the representation of stations and orders in order to make cargo go from a Station A to a Station B. Route networks are stored in graphs (not graphics, graphs in the mathematical sense!) There exists one Route Network for each cargo type.

''Vertex'' is the representation of a station in the graph. For this purpose, "Station" and "Vertex" are interchangeable. However each station is represented by one vertex per cargo type.

''Edge'' is something that connects two vertices. If any vehicle has an order that causes it to load a specific cargo type at a station P and unload the same cargo type at station Q, a directed edge connects P to Q (but not necessarily Q to P).

''Routed'' cargo is any kind of cargo that has one specific destination

''Unrouted'' cargo is any kind of cargo that behaves like previously (i.e. can be transported to any station that accepts it)

''Transit Station'' is a station where the vehicle stops, but the cargo remains in the vehicle and moves on

''Transfer Station'' is a station where the vehicle stops and the cargo deboards to continue its trip on another vehicle

''Terminal Station'' is the station where the cargo ultimately wishes to go to

== Features ==


Features:
* Destinations are assigned by station size and distance
* Destinations can be activated and deactivate in a running game
* Independent settings for Passengers, Mail, Valuable-type cargo, and other cargo.
* Fast
* Network-Safe

== Limitations ==
* Intermediate stops are not taken into account. For local trains, you'll have to set orders to each and every station it is supposed to go to. Concepts on how to overcome this are under consideration

== Items for version 2 ==
This is stuff which will ''not'' be in the first incarnation of cargodest, no matter how much you bug us ;)
* Symmetric cargo generation (Passengers and Mail), i.e. the same amount of passengers go from A to B as vice versa. This requires a rewrite of the cargo generation system and is currently not within the scope of the project. It's big enough as it is
* Adjust cargo generation to network (if you only have one power station connected, you just get less coal than when you have five)
* Distinguish between a transit and transfer station, so that cargo prefers to stay in the vehicle
** Preview finished, test phase
* Route load balancing (don't send everything via the cheapest route)
* Full handling of conditional orders
* MAYBE: Distance dependency depends on town size

== Known problems ==
* The game asserts sometimes when switching from unrouted to routed cargo. This is because sometimes cargopackets get a destination that is their current position.

== Missing features ==
* Modification of the vehicle detail window so that is shows the origins
* New icon for the Route Network view of the map: Suggestion: [[File:en/Community/Patches/Minimaprouting.png]] Full quality TIF here: [http://www.fvfischer.de/minimaprouting.tif]

== Usage ==
CargoDest is easy enough to use: Once it is enable in the GUI or the configuration file (openttd.cfg in most cases), the cargo will find its routes themselves. The Routing Network is built up using the orders of the vehicles. If you have two vehicles, one which goes from A to B and another from B to C, there will be cargo that wishes to from A to C. In this case, the cargo at A will board '''''any''''' vehicle that goes to B (The ''transfer station''), leave there and then use '''''any''''' vehicle that goes to C. Any vehicle implies any vehicle going directly from A to B, vehicles with have a stopover in D (thus go A-D-B) will not be used.

{{en/Note|When your vehicles have Transfer orders, they will be ignored, the cargodest system handles it automatically. Transfer orders don't break anything, they're also not removed, they just act like any normal order does}}

[[File:en/Community/Patches/Addroute.png|frame|center]]
It should be noted that for the purpose of Routing Network, any stopover a vehicle has (a ''transit station'') is treated exactly like a ''transfer station''.

Nothing needs to be done to build up the routing system, see the example on the right.

The first four orders don't add any route from one station to another, but they're there for some kind of realistic depot usage of the train.

However, as order #5 is inserted, the routing system parses the new data and adds a new ''edge'' from Badinghead (Station <0>) to Senpool(<1>). It also adds an edge for the return trip. Both edges get a cost of 105, and are shown in the minimap.

The route is added both for passengers and mail as it seems that the train can carry both types of cargo.

== Windows/Unix Binary ==

Available via [http://www.openttd.org/download-cargodest openttd.org/download-cargodest]

== Code ==

Available via [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/ mercurial]:
* [http://hg.openttd.org/developers/celestar/cargodest.hg/| Celestar]


So for example:

    hg clone http://hg.openttd.org/developers/celestar/cargodest.hg/ cargodest-celestar



=== Concept ===

The basic idea of the implementation was to make the whole system as little intrusive as possible. The whole cargo handling system has been moved into a new base class, and the derived classes determine whether it is "routed" or "unrouted"

Check the doxygen documentation of the tree for more info, everything is documented in there

== Dependencies ==

In addition to the normal libraries and such that OpenTTD trunk requires, you will need the development headers/libraries for [http://www.boost.org/ Boost] - specifically, the Boost Graph library. Both versions 1.34 and 1.35 should work.

Under debian/ubuntu, this is provided via the libboost-graph-dev package, which also depends on the various other required portions of Boost.

So for example:

    sudo aptitude install libboost-graph-dev

On Mac OSX these can be installed from [http://www.macports.org/ MacPorts]:

    sudo port install boost

For Windows installer try [http://www.boostpro.com/products/free]:

== Compiling ==

The normal configure/make applies as well. Note, however, that the ./configure script currently does not support/check the boost libraries.

    ./configure
    make

== Configuring ==

A couple of new patches are available:

{|
|+ 
! GUI Category || Patch !! Values !! Description
|-
| Interface
| gui.default_cargo_view
|
* 0 = All sources and destinations (Full View)
* 1 = Destinations only
* 2 = Next hop only
* 3 = Tree
|
What kind of listing to display in the station window by default
|-
| Economy
|
* economy.pax_dest_type
* economy.mail_dest_type
* economy.gold_dest_type
* economy.other_dest_type
| 
* 0 = normal
* 1 = (reserved)
* 2 = destinations
|
Whether or not to use the new destination behaviour for various cargo types 
|}

Further options are available in the config file in the [rn] section:
{|
|+ 
! Patch !! Default Values !! Description
|-
| 
* aircraft_penalty_factor
* train_penalty_factor
* road_penalty_factor
* ship_penalty_factor
|
* 1
* 2
* 3
* 4
|
The "cost" of a route is the distance (Manhattan) times the vehicle penalty factor, which can be set from 1 to 10. The default settings will have cargo prefer the faster vehicle types
|-
| stopover_penalty
| 25
| This is the base cost of a route (that is added to the length-dependent part). The higher this value (from 1 to 1000), the more likely cargo will use direct trains over ones with stopover. This especially plays a role when there are routes on different vehicle types from A to B.

== Minimap Route Network ==

[[File:en/Community/Patches/Paxdest-graph.png|thumb|An example of a graph showing the route network]]

The minimap got a new icon which shows the route network of the game.

{{en/-}}

== Console ==

There's a new console command called "rn" in the game, which has a number of subcommands:

* These commands are used to obtain indices (cargo type and station index) we need for the other ones
** lv: Lists all "vertices" of the routing network along with their indices (we'll need them later). You can define a filter by using "rn lv Foo". This will list only stations that start with "Foo" in their name.
** lc: Lists all cargo types with their indices
* These commands can be used to analyse your network:
** le: Lists all outgoing edges of a station for a given cargotype. This needs the cargo type and the station in index form (to be obtained from 'lv' and 'lc'.
** fr: Manually finds a route from one vertex to another. This needs one cargo type and two stations in index form
* Debugging stuff:
** rr: Resets the whole routing network and start from scratch. *Believe it or not, this is network safe on both server and client. You shouldn't need it anyway, it's in there for testing
** dl: Shows the destination list. This dumps the cache that is stored for each GoodsEntry of each Station. It's only used for debugging purposes and it's output should be identical to the NextHop view of the station list. We see how many pieces of cargo go via what NextHop.

== Station Cargo List ==

The Station Cargo List will be one of your main tools to work with. To ease network optimization,
several different cargo views are available in the station view window:

* Conventional View
* Detailed Views:
** Full View
** Destination View
** NextHop View
** Tree View
** Source View

You can expand the conventional view to a detailed view, which gives you more information about the waiting cargo's routing. It's possible to switch between the different detailed views by using the drop down box in the in station view. The view type can be set for each window individually, and the default view type (which will be selected each time you open a window) can be set in the advanced options (Patch options?)

[[File:en/Community/Patches/Svw retract.png|frame|conventional view]]
=== Conventional View ===
We all know this view from the early days of TTO, but it doesn't reveal much information except how much cargo we have for each type.

The little "+" sign indicates that there is more information about this cargo type. This is available for routed and unrouted cargo, however, the unrouted cargo needs this by far not as badly as the routed stuff. Click on the "+" and you can be bombarded with loads of information.

[[File:en/Community/Patches/Svw full.png|frame|"full" view - Shows origin and destination for everything]]
=== Full View ===
This is possibly less useful a view but it's there nonetheless. It shows, for every piece of the selected cargo type, the origin and the destination. This is more for the detail-loving people among us than to really help optimizing your network.

Yellow lines indicate cargo that transfers at this station (i.e. comes from somewhere else and goes one), while black lines show cargo that originated here (i.e. has never been transported before)

The main problem with it is the sheer amount of entries you get even for a mid-sized station as the one displayed.

The Full View can be sorted alphabetically (by destination) or by the amount of cargo.

[[File:en/Community/Patches/Svw destination.png|frame|"destination" view - Shows the ultimate destination of the cargo]]

=== Destination View ===
Here we go simple and straightforward again. We see all the destinations are currently "in use" along with the amount. However, we don't know how the cargo is attempting to get there.

The Destination View can be sorted alphabetically or by the amount of cargo.

[[File:en/Community/Patches/Svw nexthop.png|frame|"nexthop" view - Shows the station the cargo wishes to go next, independent of the question whether the cargo will leave the vehicle there or not]]
=== NextHop View ===
We call this the NextHop view.

The term NextHop refers to the station an piece of cargo will go to next. What is important to understand that the piece of cargo might '''not''' leave the vehicle at the NextHop, should the vehicle then continue to the following NextHop.

This is quite helpful if you have a lot of cargo at a station and need to find out where you have to send your vehicles to transport them. The good thing about this view is that it's not very cluttered, since the number of NextHops is always rather limited, even for large stations.

The NextHop View can be sorted alphabetically or by the amount of cargo.

[[File:en/Community/Patches/Svw tree.png|frame|"tree" view - Shows a logical tree where the cargo is going from the current station, includes information on how many units transfer or arrive at subsequent stations]]

=== Tree View ===
This view is possibly the most useful, if you get used to it. It shows a forward-tree of the cargo and its destinations (i.e. forward tree because this tree doesn't care about where the cargo comes from).

Each level of indentation indicates an additional hop between the current station and the one displayed. So, the stations that are not indented are the NextHops. However, here we can see what amount of cargo actually uses the NextHop as a destination, and the number that uses it as a transfer point (including the ones staying on board). There, we see the NextHops from there, but only the amount from the current station (i.e. the one who the window belongs to), and so on.

This can for example be helpful to determine where to introduce new non-stop services to, to reduce the number of Hops the cargo needs to take and reduce congestion at transfer points once they become saturated.

Should there be a cargo for which no route can be found, it is shown in red in the Tree View along with a "no route found" remark.

The Tree View cannot, at this point, be sorted.

== Vehicle Cargo List ==

You can view the destinations of the loaded cargo in the "Total Cargo" Tab of train detail windows. The sources of the cargo are not shown.
For other types of vehicles it is not (yet) possible to view cargo routing information.
