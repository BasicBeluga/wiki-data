[[Translation:en/Community/Patches/Patches]]
Patch(es) can refer to some different things:

* Before 0.7 [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings]] were called patches.
* Source code patches, also called "diff"s, as can be found in the [http://tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=33 development forum] and in the [[en/Archive/Community/List of patches| list of patches]]. You'll need to [[:Category:en/Development/Compiling OpenTTD|compile openttd yourself]] to use these.
