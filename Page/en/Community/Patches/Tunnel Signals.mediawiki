Tunnels and Bridges with signals.

Not being able to use signals in long tunnels and bridges limited their use dramatically.
I normally located depots next to them as to absorb traffic jams.
I made a solution now that simulates signals in the tunnel.
The working is quite simple.
Every time after a train enters the tunnel, it becomes invisible for the train behind it.
When the train behind is faster it will be stopped when coming to close to the train in front.
This is the same as putting a signal on every tile along the track.
The distance between trains can be regulated between 2 and 16 tiles in the advanced settings.

__TOC__


== Features ==

* Allowing more than one train at the same time inside tunnel or on bridge.
* Preventing trains from entering tunnel/bridge if train is coming from the other direction.
* Allowing two way traffic.
* Ability to see which trains are inside tunnel

== Activation ==

* To activate this option click the button in the "Advanced Settings" screen.
* You can also change the distance between each train here(2,4,8,16 tiles).

* Making it a tunnel / bridge with signals just build a signal on the entrance.
* Removing the signal from tunnel / bridge is the same as with normal signals

== Tunnel use ==

The tunnel can be entered from two directions.
However the moment a train enters the tunnel it assumes a one-way status.
This means that as long as there are trains inside the tunnel that status is maintained and trains following the train already inside will have priority over trains from the opposite direction.

To control trains that are inside the tunnel you should click on the tunnel entrence in order to make them visible.

=== One-way traffic ===
[[File:en/1way.png|frame|One-way tunnel configuration]]
One-way traffic is made possible by placing [[en/Manual/Signals#one-way-signals|one way block signals]] on both sides of the tunnel.








=== Two-way traffic ===
[[File:en/2way.png|frame|Two-way tunnel configuration]]
By using a combination of path and block signals.

* 2 [[en/Manual/Signals#one-way-signals|one way block signal]]
