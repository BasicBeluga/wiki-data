Tunnels with signals.

Not being able to use signals in long tunnels limited their use dramatically.
I normally located depots next to them as to absorb traffic jams.
I made a solution now that simulates signals in the tunnel.
The working is quite simple.
Every time after a train enters the tunnel, it becomes invisible for the train behind it.
When the train behind is faster it will be stopped when coming to close to the train in front.
This is the same as putting a signal on every tile along the track.
The distance between trains in the tunnel is approximately 2 tiles.

== Features ==

* Allowing more than one train at the same time inside tunnel.
* Preventing trains from entering tunnel if train is coming from the other direction.
* Allowing two way traffic.

== Activation ==

* To activate this option click the button in the "Advanced Settings" screen.[[File:en/Advset.png|frame|Advanced Settings: Simulate signals in tunnel]]












== Tunnel use ==

=== One-way traffic ===
[[File:en/1way.png|frame|One-way tunnel configuration]]
One-way traffic is made possible by placing [[en/Manual/Signals#one-way-signals|one way block signals]] on both sides of the tunnel.








=== Two-way traffic ===
[[File:en/2way.png|frame|Two-way tunnel configuration]]
By using a combination of path and block signals.
