Tunnels with signals.

Not being able to use signals in long tunnels limited their use dramatically.
I normally located depots next to them as to absorb traffic jams.
I made a solution now that simulates signals in the tunnel.
The working is quite simple.
Every time after a train enters the tunnel, it becomes invisible for the train behind it.
When the train behind is faster it will be stopped when coming to close to the train in front.
This is the same as putting a signal on every tile along the track.
The distance between trains in the tunnel is approximately 2 tiles.
