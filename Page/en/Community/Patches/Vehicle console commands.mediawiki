Help for vehicle console commands.

There are five commands that can be used to control vehicles. They all have same syntax, they just differ in which types of vehicles they affect and some subcommands work only on some vehicle types (for example selling train wagons work only with trains).

{|
|Command||Function
|-
|'''rail'''||Control trains (rail vehicles)
|-
|'''road'''||Control road vehicles (trucks, buses, trams)
|-
|'''ship'''||Control ships
|-
|'''aircraft'''||Control aircrafts (alias for this command is '''plane''')
|-
|'''vehicle'''||Control all types of vehicles
