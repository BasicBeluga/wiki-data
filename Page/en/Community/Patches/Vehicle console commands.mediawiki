Help for vehicle console commands.

There are five commands that can be used to control vehicles. They all have same syntax, they just differ in which types of vehicles they affect and some subcommands work only on some vehicle types (for example selling train wagons work only with trains).

{|
|Command||Function
|-
|'''rail'''||Control trains (rail vehicles)
|-
|'''road'''||Control road vehicles (trucks, buses, trams)
|-
|'''ship'''||Control ships
|-
|'''aircraft'''||Control aircrafts (alias for this command is '''plane''')
|-
|'''vehicle'''||Control all types of vehicles

=== Synopsis ===

Invoke command on specified vehicle(s).

Usage:

 vehicle <identifier> <command> [<optional command parameters...>]

Command can be:
{|
|  center        ||  Center main view on vehicle's location (Aliases: centre)
|-
|  clone         ||  Clone vehicle, if it is in depot. Have no effect on vehicles outside depots.
|-
|  clone_shared  ||  Same as clone, but with shared orders.
|-
|  count         ||  Count vehicles matching given criteria. This command will do nothing, but you'll see how many vehicles are matched by the identifier
|-
|  depot         ||  Send vehicle to depot, unless it is in one already.
|-
|  ignore        ||  Ignore signals. Valid only for trains.
|-
|  info          ||  Show vehicle info on console. Some basic statistics like maximum speed, etc ... are printed to console for each matched vehicle.
|-
|  interval      ||  Set servicing interval. Parameter specifies new interval in days or in percent, according to what is set in patches configuration.
|-

|-
|  skip          ||  Skip to next order. Optional parameter specifies how many orders to skip ('r' = skip to random order in the list, default is 1 - skip to next order).

 'all' or '*' for all vehicles
 'crashed' for all crashed vehicles
 name of group for all vehicles from specified group. Can accept unique prefix of group name
 vehicle number for specific vehicle
Operators < > <= and >= can be used instead of = for following matches:
 len=[value] for matching train length (in tiles)
 maxspeed=[value] for matching maximum speed (in km/h)
 orders=[value] for matching number of orders
 group=[name] for matching group by name
 profit=[value] for matching sum of this and last year's profit (in pounds)
 profit_this=[value] for matching this year's profit (in pounds)
 profit_last=[value] for matching last year's profit (in pounds)
 service=[value] for matching service interval (in days/percent)
 speed=[value] for matching current speed (in km/h)
