This section contains '''basic tips''' about aesthetic gameplay. Certain areas, such as railways, have pages of their own.

==General==
Adding aesthetic elements to your game is time consuming. You might consider changing the setting to allow all actions while paused.

One of the central concepts of aesthetics in OpenTTD is realism. Providing passenger platforms at a coal mine alongside hill-busting tunnels and very closely spaced signals may produce more profit. Aesthetic players steer clear of these and prefer to use game elements which are much closer to real life.

==Building==
* Try to avoid 90Â° railway turns, because they look bad and non-realistic (you can turn it off in the "Advanced settings" menu).
