==What is cooperative gameplay?==
Co-operative (or coop) gameplay is when one or more people run a company using the multiplayer system, working together to achieve the same goals. This style of gameplay requires great skills, as you have to know what other people are doing all the time, and make sure you don't use up too many funds.

==Who plays it?==
A small group of players in [irc://irc.freenode.net#openttdcoop #openttdcoop] on Freenode.
