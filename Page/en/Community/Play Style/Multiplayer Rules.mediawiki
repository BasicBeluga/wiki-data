[[Translation:en/Community/Play Style/Multiplayer Rules]]
The multiplayer feature of OpenTTD enables you to play against other people from all around the world. In order to have a fun and fair game, there are some simple rules of thumb you can follow.
The [[en/Archive/Development/Miscellaneous suggestions/Centralised authentication]] feature will allow people breaking any of the established rules to be banned from playing on any of the servers.

Each server may have different rules and most of the servers that currently run are not official open TDD servers which means they are not monitored by any open TTD staffmembers, server operators or administrators.
If you run into trouble try contacting the administrator or operator of the server you are playing on.
If you find an server admin himself is behaving badly use the [[en/Server Blacklist]] to report this server admin to warn other players about his or her behaviour.



''The following rules apply to each of the servers official and non official.''<br>
; Don't intentionally block access to industries, large area's of the map or area's that another player is building in. : If you find another player is building where you wanted to create tracks or roads of your own do not use the road, track or buy land tools to hinder their build progress leaving no way to build arround it but rather try to allow bypassing your construction in an acceptable manner. <br>Buying exclusive transport rights in an town in which you do not have any stakes also counts as blocking access to industries and is also frowned upon.

; Don't cheat to advance yourself within the game. : Joining an company operated by someone else or starting another company to transfer money to your own company is non acceptable behaviour, unless the originally owning player made it clear he or she is leaving the game and does not have intentions to return and offers it or it's resources to anyone else who wants them. <br>If you discover an exploit which creates wealth, gives an unfair advantage against other players or prevents the normal operation of the game server report it to the OpenTTD developers so the vulnerability can be closed. <br>Don't abuse bugs or exploits because this only harms open TTD gameplay and destroys the gameplay of other people.

; Chat system : When useing the chat system prevent the use of inappropriately gruesome and/or hideous subjects, discriminatory remarks which are sexually explicit, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive or excessively obscene vulgar language. <br>Also do not discus the use of any illegal activity or provide links to sites that contain any of the aforementioned. <br>Remember the open TTD games are played by people of all ages.

; Always follow the rules set down by the server owner. : These may include no 'industry stealing' where one player starts a more competitive route than another. <br>This probably varies on an per server basis so if and when an server administrator or operator asks you to stop current activities if they do not follow the server's guidelines then do so because excessive rule breaking may results in an ban which might prevent you to play on any of the official and non official open TTD servers.

; Whatever you do don't get revenge. : If other people buy all land arround your stations or cut you off with rails, road or with the buy land tools do not get 'revenge' by blocking their stations or any of the above. <br>This makes you one of them and the server administrators or operators may not be able to differantiate between who started it and may decide to kick or ban both.



''By not following these guidelines you may, at the least, annoy other players.
Players who continue to play unfairly may find themselves warned, kicked or even banned from a server by a server operator.''
