[[Translation:en/Community/Play Style/Multiplayer Rules]]
The multiplayer feature of OpenTTD enables you to play against other people from all around the world. In order to have a fun and fair game, there are some simple rules of thumb you can follow. In the future, the [[en/Archive/Development/Miscellaneous suggestions/Centralised authentication]] feature will allow people breaking the following rules to be banned for good:

:* Try not to obstruct other players in the game. Intentionally blocking access to industries, large areas of the map or areas that another player is building in with your own track, roads, or with the buy land tool is generally frowned upon. Buying exclusive rights in a town in which you have no stake is also frowned upon.

:* Don't cheat to advance yourself within the game. Joining an unused company or starting another company and then transferring money to your own company is a no-no. If you discover an exploit which gives you untold wealth, report it to the OpenTTD developers so the vulnerability can be closed.

:* Avoid using obscenities. OpenTTD is a game which is enjoyed by people of all ages and obscenities are not normally necessary.

:* Follow the rules set down by the server owner. These may include no 'industry stealing' where one player starts a more competitive route than another.

:* Don't get revenge. If other people buy all land around or cut you off with rails, do not get 'revenge' by blocking their stations or any of the above. This makes you one of them.

By not following these guidelines you may, at the least, annoy other players. Players who continue to play unfairly may find themselves warned, kicked or even banned from a server by a server operator.


You should know that most of the game servers are not run by the OpenTTD Team, there are only a few which are actually official. As for the remainder of servers, the OpenTTD have no control whatsoever over them, therefore if you have any problems you should try to contact the person who runs the server. DO NOT contact the devs as they will NOT be able to help you. There is now a [[en/Server Blacklist]] to let other players know about admins of the servers that act badly . These limitations are to be addressed in the future with a [[en/Archive/Development/Miscellaneous suggestions/Centralised authentication]] system.
