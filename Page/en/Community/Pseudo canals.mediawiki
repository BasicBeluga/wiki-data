[[en/Manual/Water Transport Tiles]] are very costly to build. Let us imagine that you want to join these two water pools with a canal:

Often you won't have enough money to make this a real canal, so what can be done?

==Creating a pseudo canal==
Firstly, lower all the land between the canals but one point on each shore. This won't cost much, as you do this kind of thing very often, like when you build a [[en/Community/Junctionary/Links|train junction]].

Now, lower the two remaining dots and see the water flowing into your canal!

Voila, you've created the canal in a much cheaper way!

You could also have made it wider, if you wanted to.
