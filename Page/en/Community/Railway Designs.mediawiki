=Carrying capacity of your network=


So you've built a network, and you can gaze at it, get a feel for how much your junctions are jamming, but you have no idea how to quantify the carrying capacity or know when it's time to build a new track, and when it's time to simply optimise a bit more.

Rule 1 of good network design: '''trains on the network ''never'' slow down'''

Let's consider the various factors that affect your carrying capacity.


==Signal distance (SD)==

[[File:en/Community/Pat Fig1.png|frame|right|Figure 1, Minimum train gap of five from a signal distance of 4]]

This is a fairly obvious one. Widely-spaced signals will result in a lower carrying capacity. With an '''SD''' of one signal every N tiles, the minimum gap between two full-speed trains can never be less than N+1 (Figure 1). When trains are this close together, you have reached the theoretical maximum train density. In practice, reaching this density is impossible. 

===So what signal distance should I use?===

* Two tiles
An '''SD''' of two gives a minimum gap of 3, and is the optimal practical solution. 

*One tile
An '''SD''' of one is fraught with problems. Even a track split causes a signalling gap. It would be possible to join angled rails with a signal gap of 1, but this would result in a considerable increase in build complexity.

* Half tile
Angled track is capable of double density signals. This may be of theoretical interest, or for shaving a few millimeters off a near-miss situation.

[[File:en/Community/Pat Fig2.png|frame|right|Figure 2, A signalling gap spells disaster!]]
Whatever '''SD'''  you choose, one important consideration is consistency. The capacity of a track is determined by whichever individual signal gap is the largest. Thus, a track with one signal every two tiles, that has an anomalous one-off gap of three or four tiles, will suffer from greatly diminished capacity and can potentially jam and violate rule 1 (Figure 2).

==Train length (TL)==


This is a double-edged sword. A longer train will increase the likelihood of incurring a realistic acceleration penalty, making construction more spread out and complex. However, a longer train length increases the maximum cargo capacity of your network. Note that when using engines that have a front and rear sections, the additional 1/2 tile taken up makes shorter train lengths even less favourable. 

Typical values of three to five tiles are normal, with four being a particular favourite for high-speed networks.


==Quantifying carrying capacity==

===Train Density (TD)===

Your network will carry a certain number of trains, and assuming you have a standardised train length, we can define some metrics. The '''Train Density (TD)''' is given in units of trains per track per thousand tiles, and can be calculated by counting the number of trains on a single track and dividing by the length of the track. 

Typical measured values for an unoptimised network of 4-tile trains are a '''TD''' of 25 trains per track per 1000 tiles.

The maximum '''TD''' before traffic jams become self-propogating can be measured by permitting a queue of trains to accelerate from a halt and then measuring the train-train distance when all trains have reached full speed, and using the formula 

'''1000 / (TL + train gap)'''

For example, a fully-laden 4-tile chimera (top-end maglev) was found to have a train-train distance of 12, giving critical density of 1000/16 or 62.5.

Because this critical density incorporates information about acceleration and time to reach top speed, it can also tell you about the practical capacity of your network. For example, using trains with a lower top speed actually makes it easier to have a dense network. The average train-train gap is much smaller for rail than for monorail or maglev. Repeating the previous example but using the electric rail T.I.M gives a train-train distance of only 6, a critical density of 100. Slow doesn't mean better, however, as the reduced line density will be more than compensated for by quick turnaround times.

It is possible to run a network at higher than the critical density, but it takes [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cojones balls].

===Theoretical Maximum Train Density===

Simply put, this is the train density if your network is entirely filled with trains at the minimum distance between each other. You will never reach this. 

This is given by ''' 1000 / (TL + SD + 1) '''

For example, 4-tile trains and a signal distance of 2 will give a theoretical maximum train density of 140.


==Carrying Capacity (CC)==


Since '''TL''' alters the carrying capacity of a line, comparing '''TD''' across different '''TL''' is meaningless. In order to compare efficiency figures between different personal preferences, we need a new metric. This new metric will simply be a measure of how many units of cargo your network is transporting per year, per track. It will be directly proportional to the average quantity of cargo per track tile, and also to how fast this cargo is moving.

Work on this unit is pending.


=Making your network more efficient=

Ok, so now that we've defined the parameters that we had already intuitively understood, how can we use them to improve our networks? The golden rule of network optimisation is that trains on the network never slow down. There are two possible parts of a network where this could happen, splits and merges.

==Splits==
For a track split, one must ensure that there is not a longer-than-normal signalling gap at the split point. This can be taken care of by careful or over-abundant signalling.

==Merges==
Merges present us with a unique problem. For a trivial merge, trains on the mainline could potentially be stopped by a sideline train. There is already a body of work on [http://www.openttdcoop.org/wiki/Priorities Priorities] by our colleagues in the cooperative circuit. A perusal of this link should familiarise you with the principles of priority merges.

Consider a typical merge situation, at the exit of a pickup station. A tightly-packed optimised stream of trains enters the station, but because of differences in loading times, this order is disrupted on the station exit, and you end up with two tracks of loosely-packed trains. One of these lines, designated the main line, will have, on average, train-train gaps large enough to fit a third train into. Simply connecting the two lines together will not work, and a priority merge is required.

Note that, because trains that drop off cargo always spend the same length of time at a platform, it is possible to dematerialise and reassemble a tightly packed stream of trains, even one above the critical density! [[:File:en/Community/Diamond Stream.png|as shown here.]]

[[File:en/Community/Priority Merge.png|frame|right|Figure 3, Priority merge]] A first-pass merge using a priority block will reduce the traffic ratio from 1:1 to about 3:1 in favour of the main track (Figure 3). Adding a second priority merge straight after the first one would be a futile gesture, since trains on both lines would continue at the same speed and the mainline train would simply claim priority again. Introducing a delay by a loop of track, followed by a second priority merge, will reduce the sideline to a mere trickle of trains and will have filled in most of the available slots on the mainline. Existing solutions would involve a pre-acceleration track, however a cyclotron eliminates the need to lose momentum.


===Cyclotrons===

Consider a sideline that loops back on itself after a failed priority merge. A train in this loop would continue to re-test the mainline for entry conditions, once every 8 * '''TL'' tiles until it found a space large enough to merge with the main line. After the cyclotron was empty, the next waiting train could pre-accelerate and be injected into the cyclotron, ready to continue the cycle. This system has some flaws, however, as it has a capacity of one train and there will be many missed opportunities due to the train being in the wrong position in the accelerator. The design is pictured [[:File:en/Community/Simple Cyclotron.png|Here]] for reference.

Refinements to the cyclotron are possible. There is enough space on the track loop to contain two trains, and a system of priority signals will enable a second train to optionally enter the cyclotron. With two trains in the cyclotron, there will be a doubled chance of entering a slot on the mainline. In order to prevent a traffic jam inside the cyclotron (which would be disasterous), some delay tweaking is necessary, but the end result is exceedingly useful.

The injection delay assumes that the second injected train is accelerating from standstill, and there is a small chance that second train has in fact chanced upon the cyclotron entrance at full speed. In this case, the timing will be wrong and the second train will almost certainly cause a jam within the cyclotron (and consequently on the main line). This can be compensated for by some additional signalling to filter out full-speed trains. The filtered out full-speed trains can either be diverted onto a second loop, or simply drained of momentum by a signal. The latter approach is that shown below.
