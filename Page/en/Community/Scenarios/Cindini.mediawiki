This article aims to organize the work on Whopper's unfinished Cindini map ([http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=34368 TT-Forums Thread] / [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=30769&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0 Old TT-Forums Thread]). More details will follow soon.

== Introduction ==

For a short introduction and a little background information some quotes Whopper's [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=30769 forum post]:

''"During an internship in Africa I had to fill in many hours of free time on an ancient computer, so I had to find a game that didn't need a good computer and that could take you occupied for ages: so I downloaded good old TTD.''

''The only thing I always hated about TTD was that the infrastructure of cities was terrible and that a city always was nothing more then a big mess of streets and buildings put together. So I started making a Latin American/ Caribbean based map and tried to make the cities more realistic and real.''

''Unfortunately you can't customarily place buildings like in Locomotion so I needed to create the cities with a huge amount of placing roads deleting and expanding.''

''Now I am back home I unfortunately don't have the amount of time any more to finish the map but I hoped that someone might be interested in helping me out?"''


and


''"You really don't want to know how much time I spend on it, especially the big cities take a hugh amount op effort :-)''

''I would like help from people to finish it, because I know that if I am going to do the rest on my own with my current lack of free time that it will take ages. So if you are creative, have some knowledge about city infrastructure, enoug free time and would like to help finish this map, please mail me @ marijnheitkamp@gmail.com''

''It's on the largest map size of open TTD, the northern part is almost finished so I think it's about 40% done."''

== Project Team ==

* Whopper - project leader/owner
* Sleepie - volunteer

== Design Rules ==
Because multiple persons are working on the map we have several "design rules" to ensure the map stays on a high quality.

=== Road types ===
Because openTTD doesn't include different types of road yet we are representing the importance of a road in other ways, in general we have the following three types of roads:

<center>[[File:en/Community/Scenarios/Roadtypes.jpeg|center|frame| - Different roadtypes]]</center>

:;Regular road: The regular road is just the normal road that can be used anywhere, there are hardly any restrictions on how to make use of this type of road as long as they make sense. When building a road from one place to another bear in mind that they are not necessarily straight, so try to shape the road by its enviroment, instead of going through or over mountains or over cliffs try to let them go around those. Also try to make only 1 level of elevation behind eachother so instead of going straight to the top they will sway slowly up. When using bridges with the normal road types try to use cheap bridges instead of expensive ones. While playing on the map these curves and elevations will make a normal road less attractive then a highway or freeway.

:;Highway: Highways are important roads between cities or inside cities. The highway is a single road that is elevated 1 level higher than its surrounding. Inside cities you should try to not directly build buildings next to the highway but leave 1 block of space. Try to make the highway go as straight as possible without using too much elevation. Highways go through mountains or over cliffs instead of swaying around them. You can directly connect any regular road to the Highway but try to avoid to connect too many roads to a highway behind eachother.

:;Freeway: The freeways are the most important roads mostly connecting metropolises or large cities together or they are used in a ring around a metropolis. The freeway is a double road elevated 2 or more levels higher than its surrounding with both roads built on a slope making it normally impossible for any road to connect with it. To connect a freeway with a road, highway and other freeways you should use four connections from the specific road to the freeway like on the picture below. Freeways go as straight as possible, and have as little elevation as possible. Instead of changing the freeway to the terrain, change the terrain to suit the freeway. Inside large cities and metropolises sometimes double roads are used, but these are not freeways, freeways are always elevated and have special "ramps" which connect them to normal roads and highways.

=== Creating a city ===

<center>[[File:en/Community/Scenarios/Tut city.gif|center|frame| - How to create a city in 3 steps]]</center>

:;Step1: Make a "global plan" for the city by placing the important roads (see the above picture), you can also place canals or roads on places that you plan to hold free from any buildings (like a park or the space beside a highway). In this case I built a single highway with some mayor side roads.

:;Step2: Actually place the city and expand it to the size that you find suitable.

:;Step3: Is the most time consuming step and can take up to several hours for metropolises. You have to clean up the city by deleting useless roads or illogical roads and expand/delete to get certain types of buildings into certain areas. For instance in this picture I tried to make some squares with high buildings around it while the rest of the city consist of luxury low level buildings. After making sure the buildings and roads are fixed I usually fill up the empty areas with trees and hills.

=== Creating a mountain range ===

<center>[[File:en/Community/Scenarios/Tut mountain.gif|center|frame| - How to create a mountain range in 3 steps]]</center>

:;Step1: Make the shape of the mountain with the land generation tool.

:;Step2: Cover the elevated area with rocky ground.

:;Step3: Add trees: place lushy green trees around the mountains on the normal surface while placing the more sober trees on the mountain itself, placing them on plateaus and on some of the slopes.

=== Impiriata ===
[[File:en/Community/Scenarios/Impiriata.png|frame| - Flag of Impiriata]]

:;Capital city: Capitola

:;History: After independence from europe, this country once spanned the entire western and southern part of Cindini including the sinzia freestate, large parts of Antia and the Ronian island group. In those times it was ruled by a violent dictator called Ricarneo who crowned himself “Emperor of Cindini". A lot of  people were not happy with the current regime and this resulted in bloody civil wars in the eastern provinces and borderconflicts with Antia and Rutanio. After losing ground to Antia and Rutanio and the separation of the Sinzia freestate and the Ronian Island group the country felt into an economic crisis. This led to a long time of civil unrest and eventually to a coup which ended the reign of the dictator Ricarneo. A new democratic government was installed with Diatora, a former school teacher, as the first elected president. After the election Diatora managed to stop the violence and began an age of economic prosperity. Today Impiriata has a very strong economy however a very large part of the population still lives in poverty, especially in the mainland and in the hugh slums around the major cities. 

:;Population: Impiriata has the largest population of Cindini, but most of them are gathered around the three major metropoles. The mainland however is sparsely populated.

:;Infrastructure: There are busy highways between the metropoles and the infrastructure inside the city is well developed, the mainland however lacks a good road network.

:;Economy: Impiriata’s industries are gathered around the major cities, the mainland is the breadbasket of the continent with a hugh amount of plantations.

:;Major natural resources: Fruit and Rubber

:;Environment: The largest part of  Impiriata is covered with dense rainforest, in the north however there is also a large patch of desert and highlands in the southwest.

=== The Sinzia Freestate ===
[[File:en/Community/Scenarios/Sinzia Freestate.png|frame| - Flag of the Sinzia Freestate]]

:;Capital: Mia Bonanda

:;History: Jacob Sinzia originating from a very poor family, he was a worker in the diamond mines around the mining town Mia Bonanda during the regime of Ricarneo. While the population of the town lived in poverty, the money went mostly to the corrupt government in Capitola. Not long after the war broke out in the Ronian Island district Jacob started a rebellion in one of the major mines in the Mia Bonanda region. This spark started a chain reaction and with the help of Antia who was in war with Ricarneo for a long time they managed to successfully separate themselves from Impiriata. After the revolution the country rapidly grew into a massive economic power depending on the huge amount of Diamonds found in these lands. Today the Sinzia Freestate is the richest country on the continent with Mia Bonanda as the capitol who grew from a minor mining village to a hugh metropole.

:;Population: The Sinzia Freestate has the second largest population on the continent (after Impiriata) and is densely populated.

:;Infrastructure: The Freestate has excellent infrastructure.

:;Economy: The Sinzia Freestate has the strongest and fastest growing economy on the continent. It’s considered the business capital of Cindini for foreign investors.

:;Major natural resources: Diamonds

:;Environment: Most of the country consists of desert, with the exception of the northern coast. The government recently successfully started irrigation projects inside and around Mia Bonanda to make the lands more fertile.

=== Rutanio ===
[[File:en/Community/Scenarios/Rutanio.png|frame| - Flag of Rutanio]]

:;Capital: Julegro

:;History: The first country that successfully became independent from Europe. The lands first consisted of large patches of rain forests which were cut down and exported on a massive scale, making the country very rich and powerful. But this led to the total exploitation of most natural resources on the country and the country slowly turned into a remote desert. In search for new land and resources it made countless wars with Impiriata, which led to the conquest of the northern part of the Ronian island group. But due the the long wars and growing poverty in the mainland the population of this country also started to rebel which ended in a coup installing a communistic government. The new government did not bring the peace and wealth a lot of people hoped for which led to a migration to nearby countries, especially to Antia and the Sinzia Freestate. Today Rutanio is very poor and sparsely populated, a ruin of a once mighty nation.

:;Population: The mainland of Rutanio is sparsely populated except for a few larger cities which consist mostly of slums.

:;Infrastructure: Though there are some few main roads leading to the capital, most of the countries infrastructure is in very bad shape.

:;Economy: The economy has gone downhill for a long time, though several years ago Iron Ore was found in the western provinces, which led to a slight increase in the country's economic position.

:;Major natural resources: Iron Ore, Maize

:;Environment: Almost the entire nation is covered in desert with the exception of North Ronia, the island in the south of the country.

=== Antia ===
[[File:en/Community/Scenarios/Antia.png|frame| - Flag of Antia]]

:;Capital: Antia

:;History: Antia was the latest colony on the mainland that (peacefully) gained independence from Europe, it started as just the Antioch mountain range and the swamp areas on the eastern side of the mountains. It was sparsely populated by local tribes and small European settlements. This changed when poverty became a serious problem in Rutanio, which led to a lot of farmers searching for more fertile land. Not long after their search the war broke out in the Sinzia Freestate, which led to people fleeing for the war. They took shelter in the Antioch Mountain range. Soon after the rebellion in the Freestate Antioch managed to train an army and also declared war on Impiriata which resulted in a gaining a relatively large part of Impiriata’s land. Today Antia is especially known for its beautiful nature and impressive mountains. Tho Antia is still the official capital, the economic capitals are Teloria and San Elanzo on the coast and Lavito in the west.

:;Population: While first Antia and the mountain range was the most populated region, the coastline is now the most populated area in the country.

:;Infrastructure: The infrastructure in Antia is reasonably good, recently the country build its first impressive freeway (thanks to investors from the Sinzia Freestate) from Mia Bonanda to San Elanzo which is now one of the continents major export harbors.

:;Economy: The economy is prospering in Antia, especially tourism to one of the two national parks in the country  is making a lot of money in recent years. This led to the booming of the once small mountain town of Lavito.

:;Major natural resources: Maize

:;Environment: The western part of the country consists of desert while the eastern part is a swamp area, the two areas are split by a large mountain range.

=== Murica Island ===
[[File:en/Community/Scenarios/Murica Island.png|frame| - Flag of Murica Island]]

:;Capital: Johanstad

:;History: This is the place were the first European explorer set foot on the Cindini continent. Since that time multiple European countries have occupied this island. The Europeans used this island as a major slave port from where they shipped the slaves to the main continent. Even though in 1800 all slaves gained freedom this island stays under European control until today. Since 1800 no war has been fought on this island and it grew out in a very wealthy and peaceful island with little problems.

:;Population: The island is very populated, especially around the two big cities. This island has the highest percentage of Europeans in all Cindini and most of the large companies are in the hands of European investors.

:;Infrastructure: The infrastructure on Murica Island is excellent and probably the best on the entire continent

:;Economy: While the island also produces maize and fruit, the main economic resource is tourism. Murica is one of the top tourist destination on the continent thanks to the stability of the country, the world class beaches and some of the best diving spots in the world.

:;Major natural resources: Maize and fruit

:;Environment: In general the island is green and lush while on the west side there is also a small stroke of desert.

=== Les Dianos ===
[[File:en/Community/Scenarios/Les Dianos.png|frame|- Flag of Les Dianos]]

:;Capital: Zidena

:;History: Les Dianos are a group of four islands: Dia Porto, Dia Puena, Dia Tako and Dia Nupla. Its capital, Zidena, was, for a long time, one of the most prominent European ports on the continent and the islands were one of the latest to gain independence peacefully. In general the islands have always been very peaceful and few conflicts were ever recorded. While officially being neutral during the war between Antia and Imperiata the islands were believed to support Antia both financial and military.

:;Population: Like Antia, Les Dianos has also known a great migration of people from Rutanio during the war period making it a reasonable densely populated area these days.

:;Infrastructure: The infrastructure on the island has always been relatively good compared to the mainland. Since the construction of the Dinota bridge in 1979 all the islands have been connected to each other and in 1986 the country was connected to the mainland by the huge Capota bridge.

:;Economy: The island state depends on its Rubber plantations and farms but also has been an interesting destination for tourist.

:;Major natural resources: Maize and Rubber

:;Environment: The country consists of wetlands and farmland with rock formations.

== Project Organization ==

This section is about ''Who'' is working on ''What'' and ''When''. The idea is to split the map in several (virtual) regions. Each region represents a sub-project of the whole thing. These sub-projects will be assigned to one (max. three) volunteers who will work on this until it's finished. The sub-projects will be marked with signs on the map. Additional signs that provide information about who is working on that project, what is the state (Unclaimed|Planning|WorkInProgress(%)|Finished) of it and so on might be also useful. Besides this further (detailed) information should be documented at the wiki. So we will get a 'changelog' of the progress. Discussing things could be done using several ways using the wiki, the forum, email or instant messaging, whatever is appropriate.
Because it's not possible to split the map physically some kind of project schedule is necessary to organize who can work when.
