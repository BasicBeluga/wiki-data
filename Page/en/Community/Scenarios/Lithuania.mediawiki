|description=This map contains the territory of Lithuania, big part of Latvia and also some of Belarus, Poland and Kaliningrad Oblast. The city positioning, size and overall topology are based on actual geographical data. Industries, while not completely fictional, are not representative of any real establishments.

Combined with an "Alternative costs 1.0" NewGRF, Lithuanian map provides a challenging game, with extensive farmland, rivers and hilly regions on the southeast corner of the map creating plenty of difficulties to find the best path. Industries and towns are plentiful, however, only several of them are big enough to sustain local passenger services. Vilnius-Kaunas line is an obvious starting point for any business, with Riga and Grodno providing alternative if more challenging spots.
