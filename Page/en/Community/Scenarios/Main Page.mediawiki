== Add your scenarios ==

First, you need to host your scenario somewhere on the internet. Then create a page with a screenshot of the mini map and a screenshot of your favourite part of the scenario. Put a link to your file on that page. Now find the categories you think it fits under and use the following syntax to list it: <code><nowiki>[http://www.example.org Scenario Name]</nowiki></code>

This way we can produce a comprehensive yet simple way of storing and finding scenarios.
