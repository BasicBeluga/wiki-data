== How to add your scenario? ==
You cannot upload scenarios onto this wiki, at least as far as i am aware of. So you need to get a free website and upload it to there. Create a page with a screenshot of the mini map and a screenshot of your favourite part of the scenario. Put a link to your file on that page. Now find the categories you think it fits under and place in a link for your page like this:
<nowiki>[http://www.example.org Scenario Name]</nowiki>
From there we can help produce a comprehensive yet simple way of storing and finding scenarios.
