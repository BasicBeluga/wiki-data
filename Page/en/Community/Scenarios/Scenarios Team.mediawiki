The Scenarios Team is a sort of a OpenTTD wiki version of a [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:wikiproject WikiProject]. It is a gathering of people devoted to updating the [[en/Community/Scenarios/Main Page]]. Anyone is free to join in. In fact, the team needs your help in updating the database of scenarios so that anyone can search for and download new scenarios with ease.

==Project Main Goals==

* Get as many scenario authors as possible to join and copy their scenarios from [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=12481 the forums] to [[en/Community/Scenarios/Main Page|the wiki]].
* Update the scenario database as needed.
* Maintain the aesthetics of the database.
* Collaborate to create a newbie-friendly database of freely downloadable scenarios for OpenTTD.

===Procedure to adding a scenario===

# Take a screenshot showing the minimap of your scenario (preferably medium-size, in PNG). [http://wiki.openttd.org/index.php/File:Scn-echo-minimap.png Example]
# Take a screenshot showing a detail you like about the scenario you are about to list. Again, preferably medium-size, and in PNG. [http://wiki.openttd.org/index.php/File:Scn-echo-screenshot.png Example]
# Name the above files logically and upload them to the wiki [[Special:Upload|here]].
# Add the scenario under the relevant categories using the [[Template:en/Community/Scenarios/Scenario|Scenario template]] as shown below. (When adding to [[en/Community/Scenarios/Size/Main Page]], remember to update the scenario count at the main list.)

===Frequently Asked Questions===

:;Where should .scn's be uploaded / hosted at?
::We don't really know yet. It is known that we will not be able to host them at the wiki and that the administration is currently looking into creating an another means of centralizing the files. In the mean time, we should link to whatever the authors at [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=12481 the forums] are linking to. In the case of a wholly new scenario, they can be posted at the forums first and then linked to the attachment.

:;What about a scenario rating system of some kind? 
::This is really not possible using MediaWiki. To accomplish a system like this, we would need a custom script of some kind.

:;I have some ideas/suggestions/feedback on the project. Where should I post them?
::To centralize all discussion on this project in one place, please post in List of player-made scenarios.

===Miscellaneous resources===

:;[[en/Scenarios Team/Dead scenarios]] 
::These scenarios were once in the list of player-made scenarios, but hosts of which have ceased to function. All dead scenario templates should be moved here in case a functioning link can be created and the scenario re-integrated into the list.
