The "TT Screenshot of the Month" (SOTM) is a monthly competition of player-submitted screenshots. Submitted screenshots may be based on any version of Transport Tycoon (TTO), Transport Tycoon Deluxe (TTD), TTD Patch (TTDP or TTDX), OpenTTD (OTTD) or Transport Tycoon Mobile (TTM), using any base graphics sets or NewGRF sets. Screenshots need not be actual views from the game, and may be edited to enhance the screenshot or to create a visual theme. All voting in the competition is conducted via poll on TT-Forums in the current dedicated discussion topic.

The longest sustained competition was [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=34080 first organized] by Amecheer in September 2007, later modified in March 2008, and officially ended in January 2010 after several months of inactivity. The competition was [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=46857 immediately revived] by ZxBiohazardZx, but only lasted a month itself. The [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=59459 current competition] was started by SwissFan91 in April 2012 and has ran continuously since. In January 2014, Kamnet was named the competition moderator and the competition continued under the same format. August 2015 saw the competition return to the moderation of SwissFan91.
