The "TT Screenshot of the Month" (SOTM) is a monthly competition of player-submitted screenshots. Submitted screenshots may be based on any version of Transport Tycoon (TTO), Transport Tycoon Deluxe (TTD), TTD Patch (TTDP or TTDX), OpenTTD (OTTD) or Transport Tycoon Mobile (TTM), using any base graphics sets or NewGRF sets. Screenshots need not be actual views from the game, and may be edited to enhance the screenshot or to create a visual theme. All voting in the competition is conducted via poll on TT-Forums in the current dedicated discussion topic.

= History = 
Prior to the "TT Screenshot of the Month" competition, several other attempts at organizing such competitions had existed on TT-Forums. The longest sustained competition was [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=34080 first organized] by Amecheer in September 2007, later modified in March 2008, and officially ended in January 2010 after several months of inactivity. The competition was [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=46857 immediately revived] by ZxBiohazardZx, but only lasted a month itself. The [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=59459 current competition] was started by SwissFan91 in April 2012, and has ran continuously since. In January 2014 Kamnet was named the new competition moderator, and a [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=69762 new topic] was started.

=== December 2013 ===
The December 2013 theme is ''Happy Holidays''. Due to a lack of time on SwissFan91's part, efforts to organize the December competition failed to materialize. Moderation of the competition was passed on to Kamnet.  There was also some misunderstanding about what the actual theme for December 2013 would be. SwissFan91 was the winner of the October competition and opted to select the December theme instead of the November theme. Because of the mitigating circumstances, the December 2013 and January 2014 theme were ran concurrently. The competition will conclude on January 27, 2014. 

== 2014 ==
=== January 2014 ===
The January 2014 theme is ''Out with the Old, and in with the New''. The competition will conclude on January 27, 2014.
