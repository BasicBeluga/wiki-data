The "TT Screenshot of the Month" (SOTM) is a monthly competition of player-submitted screenshots. Submitted screenshots may be based on any version of Transport Tycoon (TTO), Transport Tycoon Deluxe (TTD), TTD Patch (TTDP or TTDX), OpenTTD (OTTD) or Transport Tycoon Mobile (TTM), using any base graphics sets or NewGRF sets. Screenshots need not be actual views from the game, and may be edited to enhance the screenshot or to create a visual theme.
