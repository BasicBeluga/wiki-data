This page is to discuss the envisioned re-structuring of the game menu, newgame settings, advanced settings and options.

This is a big task and can certainly be structured into several sub-tasks

== Settings Re-arangement ==

Difficulty settings as they are present now serve little purpose as there are many (advanced) settings which have at least a strong impact as the historic difficulty settings.

#Move difficulty settings to advanced settings or the new map window (whatever appropriate for the individual setting)
##Add the capability to set the difficulty level explicity for individual NewGRFs
##Remove all highscores but custom and disable difficulty different from 'custom'
##Actually move the settings
##* This has the added benefit that they can get nice help texts as well - a feature the difficulty window doesn't yet fly.
#Move some game options to adv. settings or new map window
#Split adv. settings in user settings and map settings (maybe join user settings with game options?)
#Add settings presets to adv. settings
#*How should that be done: 
#**Different config files, one per settings pre-set? 
#**Array of values, similar to how NewGRF parameters are stored.
#**Different sections in the same config file, similar how NewGRF presets are stored
#Add "reset to default" to adv. settings
#Add "differences to default / user default settings" to adv. settings. This is especially important for network games

== Window Re-arangement ==

In general the layout could be like

#main window layout:
#* New singleplayer Game
#* Quickstart (uses current new game settings, like current ctrl+click new game)
#* Load game (incl. scenario)
#* Multiplayer
#* Highscores
#* check online content(?)
#* Quit



#new game dialog (tabs):
## map settings: [[File:en/Development/Design Drafts/Newgame draft.png|frame|draft of the re-designed new game dialogue]]
##*choice of map generator: heightmap / scenario / terragenesis / original
##*type of map borders
##*map size
##*amount water content, tree content(?)
##*morphology (mountainous,...)
## game settings
##* date
##* industry, town and tree(?) quantities
##* driving side
##* town names
##* part of current difficulty settings
##* link to(?) adv. settings, incl. some of current difficulty settings
## newgrf settings
## AI settings
#user preferences (tabs):
## general GUI:
##* base sets
##* language
##* units
##* savegame names / frequency
##* mouse behaviour
## game related:
##* UI settings from current adv. settings
