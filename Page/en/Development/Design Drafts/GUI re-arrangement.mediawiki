This page is to discuss the envisioned re-structuring of the game menu, newgame settings, advanced settings and options.

This is a big task and can certainly be structured into several sub-tasks

== Settings Re-arangement ==

Difficulty settings as they are present now serve little purpose as there are many (advanced) settings which have at least a strong impact as the historic difficulty settings.

=== Move difficulty settings ===
They need moving to the advanced settings or the new map window (whatever appropriate for the individual setting). This gives as added benefit the capability to add nice help texts to the settings as well.


This task has one or two pre-conditions:
#Add the capability to set the difficulty level explicity for individual NewGRFs
#Remove all highscores but custom and disable difficulty different from 'custom'

=== Cleanup game options ===
The game options contain a few settings which better belong to the advanced settings or new map window

=== Split user and map settings ===
This task depends on the removal of the difficulty settings and the cleanup of the game options.

A clear(er) distinction between user-settings and map settings is desirable. Maybe the user-only settings could be moved to and joined with an re-written game options window.

=== Allow settings presets ===
There are several ways how this could be achieved:
*Different config files, one per settings pre-set? 
*Array of values, similar to how NewGRF parameters are stored.
*Different sections in the same config file, similar how NewGRF presets are stored

=== Show deviations from default settings ===
Single player: Show differences to default settings
Multiplayer: Show differences to user's default settings to allow a quick overview of "what's different"

=== Reset to default settings ===
From a UI perspective: A simple button in the settings window(s) will do the trick.

== Window Re-arangement ==

In general the layout could be like

=== Main window layout ===
# New singleplayer Game
# Quickstart (uses current new game settings, like current ctrl+click new game)
# Load game (incl. scenario)
# Multiplayer
# Highscores
# check online content(?)
# Quit

=== New game dialog (tabs) ===

==== Map settings ====
[[File:en/Development/Design Drafts/Newgame draft.png|frame|draft of the re-designed new game dialogue]]
#choice of map generator: heightmap / scenario / terragenesis / original
#type of map borders
#map size
#amount water content, tree content(?)
#morphology (mountainous,...)
==== New game settings ====
# date
# industry, town and tree(?) quantities
# driving side
# town names
# part of current difficulty settings
# link to(?) adv. settings, incl. some of current difficulty settings
==== Newgrf settings ====
==== AI settings ====

=== User preferences (tabs) ===
This could be the re-design of the existing game options
==== general GUI ====
# base sets
# language
# units
# savegame names / frequency
# mouse behaviour

==== game related ====
# UI settings from current adv. settings
