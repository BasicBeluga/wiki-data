Might it be possible to make player-buildable modular airports if enough rules and safeguards are in place?

== Airport construction pieces ==

* Take-off runway (short or long)
* Landing runway (short or long)
* Combined runway (short or long)
* Hangar
* Terminal gate (loading bay)
* Helipad
* Helipad with loading bay
* Control tower
* Radar
* Taxiway
* Terminal buildings (decoration)

== Airport rules ==

* Airports can only be constructed/modified while they are closed and there are no aircraft on the ground. (There may be aircraft in hangars, in that case those hangars are locked.)
* Airports can only be opened if all requirements below are met.
* Airports are constructed by first buying land for the purpose, using a special buy land mode. The airport land becomes fenced in.
* Town noise is generated based on number and langth of runways.
* An airport must have at least one runway for take-off and one for landing, or a combined runway, or a helipad.
* If an airport has long runways it must have a control tower and a radar.
* Runways and helipads (without loading bays) and gates have taxiway connectors.
* Taxiways can be one-way or two-way.
* Taxiways are constructed similar to rail, however diagonal taxiways have a minimum distance to avoid wings clipping.
* It must be possible to move from any landing runway to any gate, and from any gate to any take-off runway.
* It must be possible to move from/to any helipad without loading bay to any gate.
* It must be possible to move from a hangar to at least one gate.
* It must be possible to move to a hangar from at least one landing runway.
* If there are no helipads, the ends of runways function as helicopter landing sites.
* An approaching aircraft circles the airport's orthogonal tile bounds until it is assigned a landing runway and a gate.
* An aircraft heading for take-off is asigned a take-off runway and reserves a path to that runway. No other aircraft can enter or cross that path, but the path can * have sections shared with other aircraft also going to take-off, as long as they move in ther same direction on the taxiway.
* A landing-only runway is free as long as it is not reserved and there is no aircraft running/standing on it.
* A combined runway is free for landing if the landing aircraft can move away from it to the first taxiway tile towards its gate immediately, even if another aircraft has the combined runway reserved for take-off, as long as the taking-off aircraft is sufficient distance from the runway.
