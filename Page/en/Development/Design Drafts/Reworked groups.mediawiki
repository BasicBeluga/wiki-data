This is a placeholder for discussion of how to rework vehicle groups to possibly support nested groups, consists, and other new features.
=The problem=
==Shared Orders==
Assigning orders to a single vehicle is done by selecting the vehicle, and modifying its order sheet.  It's been this way since 1994, and works well.  Unfortunately, assigning orders to be shared by a number of vehicles is done in the same way - except by using a Ctrl-modified click on another vehicle instead of a destination.  This creates shared orders, which can be modified on any vehicle which uses them.  This system works, but not in the most useful way.  There are a number of drawbacks:
* When a new vehicle is created, in order to get its orders sheet shared with others requires finding another vehicle which already uses those orders.  this is not easy:
** There's no list of shared orders sheets.
** There's no outwardly obvious way to tell whether a vehicle's using a shared orders sheet.
** Even if a vehicle is using a shared orders sheet, there's no way to tell if it's the right one straight away, especially with the method of copying a sheet being so close to the method for sharing a sheet.
** There are ways to try to find a suitable train quickly (station lists, groups, etc) but none of these are guaranteed to find the train you want, first time.
* When the last train using an orders sheet is destroyed (or sold), the shared orders list evaporates.  Doesn't matter how complex it was; it's gone.
* You can't plan a route for a vehicle before the vehicle exists.  This might seem counter-intuitive, but creating an orders sheet station by station as the stations are constructed, and then assigning trains to that orders sheet, is something that players might find very useful.
==Liveries==
Liveries can't be arbitrarily assigned to specific services or routes, only types of vehicle.  This is a limitation which needs to be overcome.
==Consists==
Changing the consist of a train when its purpose is changed is useful, but not possible at the moment.
=The Solutions=
One solution, which is used in [http://www.simutrans-germany.com/wiki/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=en_LineManagement], is to have a group-like interface (which might or might not be based on the current groups  seen in OpenTTD) where an orders sheet is given to a group, and vehicles which are members of that group follow the group's orders sheet rather than their own.
