The basis of the work described on this page is to extend OpenTTD so that it is possible to detect which part of a string that was clicked. Basically, was the town name in this string clicked? Yes? Lets view that town in the main viewport then. The final goal is that this functionality will be available for GUIs that display text from GameScripts. But as you can see in the Roadmap below, there will probably be two feature patches before that.


This screenshot shows a work-in-progress version of the functionality added by the click-on-chat patch:

== Roadmap ==

* 10 - Basic framework for click on parts of raw strings
* 20 - Click on town names in chat - A patch that makes use of the basic framework
* 30 - Extended framework to detect which parameter in a translatable string that was clicked
* 40 - A patch that make use of the extended framework
* 50 - Extend to GameScript parameters
* 60 - Add click-on-parameters to [[en/Development/Script/Story book|Story book]] so that a user can click on eg. a town name to center the main viewport on that town.
