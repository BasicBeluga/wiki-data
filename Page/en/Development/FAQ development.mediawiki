==SVN Intro / FAQ==
====What is the SVN version?====
Firstly let me explain what SVN is. SVN aka subversion is a version control system like CVS. Basically it controls the source code of the game. The SVN version is the latest (bleeding edge) source code for the game.

====What is the source code?====
Don't worry about it, and don't bother reading the rest of this.

====How do I get the SVN version then?====
First you need to download the client software for you operating which will connect to the SVN server and download the source code. You can get it from the SVN project homepage at http://subversion.tigris.org/. If you are using Windows you may want to get [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN] as it integrates with Explorer nicely and you won't have to run command line stuff.

Next you need to set up the client to use the repository url which is ''"svn://svn.openttd.com/openttd/trunk"''. This will depend on which software you get, but you can find out how to do this with the documentation included with it.

====What operating systems does Subversion run on?====
All modern flavors of Unix, Win32, BeOS, OS/2, MacOS X. Subversion is written in ANSI C and uses APR, the Apache Portable Runtime library, as a portability layer. The Subversion client will run anywhere APR runs, which is most places.

====Subversion has not been ported to my platform / I don't want to install more software - is there any other way I can get to the source code?====
You can view the repository online at http://svn.openttd.com/viewcvs.py/trunk/, you can also checkout copies so you will be able to get a complete set of source code. You can also get the latest nightly source code from http://www.openttd.org/nightly/ or http://openttd.rulez.org/download/nightlybuilds/linux/.

====Now I have got the source code how can I compile it?====
Have a look at the readme.txt and the docs folder. It is still a bit flaky compiling it on Windows unless you have MSVC6 though.

====I had a problem compiling! What should I do?====
This is not a compiling FAQ, so post a question in the OpenTTD Problems forum.

====Why did the developers decide to use SVN instead of something more common such as CVS?====
SVN is more advanced and easier to use. Also a lot of the developers don't like CVS any more now they know SVN.

====What is the point of a version control system? Why don't they just upload the source code to an FTP directory?====
Version control systems keep track of all the changes, when they were made and by who. If the developers later find out something they did was a mistake and broke something important they may have to rewrite it from scratch. With this they can just 'checkout' a revision from when it was working. It also allows the developers to add comments so they know what changes have been done.
