Having a consistent look and feel for the user interface is important.
This page documents how the program should present itself to the user, and how it should respond to user inter action.

A ''window'' is a rectangle at the screen that displays information to the user, and (usually) allows interaction with the user to change the displayed data.
A ''widget'' is an elementary piece of a window, for example a button, a close box, or a title bar.

== Mouse actions ==
A user should be able to do as much as possible with just a single left mouse click. For lists, such a click means selection of an item in the list.
For buttons, a click means executing the action attached to the button. For related actions that also occur often, the combination of holding down the CTRL button and clicking with the left mouse button may trigger the related action.
However, such a click should only be used as a short-cut. Not all users know that you can use the CTRL key, and such a user should be able to perform the same action without using the CTRL key, in some way.

A double left click is useful to execute an action with a selected item in a list. As with the CTRL key, not all users may understand that double clicking is possible, so it is preferable to also have an other means (for example a button) to achieve the same action (eg by pressing a button).

Pressing (and optionally holding down) the right mouse button should pop up a help text about the part of the window that the mouse pointer is. If the part has special interaction possibilities, such as double clicking or use of the CTRL key, it should be mentioned in the help text.
