== Activating newgrf developer tools ==
OpenTTD r19723 and following introduced a number of debugging tools for (New)GRF developers. In order to make them accessible the debugging tools need to be activated via a hidden setting, best via console:
<pre>
set newgrf_developer_tools 1
</pre>

Then a number of tools become available

== Sprite alignment tool ==
A simple sprite alignment helper available from the 'Information' menu on the main toolbar.

The sprite alignment tool does not store the new offsets anywhere so as soon as the sprite is reloaded the offsets are gone (use a bigger sprite cache if this happens). Also anything that reloads NewGRFs (new games, loading games or (re)applying NewGRFs) clears the sprite cache and as such resets the offsets.

A 'picker' is included to help you find the sprite you need.  This will list the sprites used at a particular screen location, try each item in the list until you find the one you are looking for.

== Variable / Property inspection tool ==
A debug tool for variables and properties is provided.  A wide range of variables and properties are included for each type of object.  Some properties are not shown as they are already obvious in either in-game (for example, vehicle name), or they are obvious in the nfo for action 0.  

The industry debug window includes the values of the 16 persistent storage locations.  This enables industry coders to debug complex varaction 2 chains by pushing values to storage (only possible for industries, vehicles, houses etc. have no persistent storage).

The debug view for variables can be accessed via the tile area information tool for all newgrfs which don't deal with vehicles (note the debug icon in the upper right of the area information window):

The debug for vehicle variables is accessed directly via the vehicle window.
