Great plugin   ulufrtonateny there appears to be a problem with page caching. If the page is not cached and the first browser to request it is IE6, then the  fixed' page is cached and served to all subsequent browsers that request it   this means the fix code will run every time on the cached page and may cause problems with other browsers. Conversely, if a non-IE6 browser requests the page for the first-time, the page will be cached without the  fix' code and then if IE6 later requests that page, it will get an unfixed cached page.It's better to leave the browser detection to the browser by using the IE conditional comments.I'm changing the wp_head() function in your plugin   I'm ignoring your browser detect code and will always write out the javascript links between conditional comments   this will ensure that a cached paged always contains the links to the javascript.Perhaps you could add an option for sites that used cached pages?
