[[Translation:en/Development/NewGRF/Incompatibility Hints]]


This page is dedicated to listing changes to NewGRFs which NewGRF authors should consider bumping the min_compatible_version to the current version of their newgrf as they have the potential to break the savegame and maybe even crash OpenTTD.

==What is (in)compatibility==
There are two kinds of compatibility:
* Changes which just add additional stuff to the NewGRF and don't influence any of exisiting things
* Changes which change the behaviour of existing things in a way that loading of a savegame works, but the game continues differently than with the previous version of the NewGRF. This is a grey area, but save to keep the compatibility maintained.
* Anything which results in a re-interpretation of the existing game state is incompatible. These are the important things to look out for

==Incompatible changes==

finally can append to it but the type aterbiutts  1  will write to the tag once i re-run the program Is that any way where it will continue the numbers instead of starting from 1 .Currently Xml file: <Books><Book type= 1 ><Author>ok</Author><Section>1</Section></Book><Book type= 2 ><Author>no</Author><Section>2</Section></Book><Book type= 1 > Not I wanted <Author>Peter</Author><Section>7</Section></Book></Books> Hope to become: <Books><Book type= 1 ><Author>ok</Author><Section>1</Section></Book><Book type= 2 ><Author>no</Author><Section>2</Section></Book><Book type= 3 > This is what I wanted <Author>Peter</Author><Section>7</Section></Book></Books> My Coding:Dim m As String =  1 Private Sub btnAdd_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnAdd.Click        Dim doc As New Xml.XmlDocument         load file        doc.Load( data.xml )        Dim root As XmlNode = doc.SelectSingleNode( //Books )        If root Is Nothing Then             if this is a new document create root            root = doc.SelectSingleNode( //Books )        Else             create node             get root node named users            Dim Usersnode As Xml.XmlElement = doc.SelectSingleNode( //Books )             add the new node            Dim newNode As Xml.XmlElement = doc.CreateElement( Book )             add aterbiutts            newNode.SetAttribute( type , m)             add children nodes if any            Dim child As Xml.XmlElement = doc.CreateElement( Author )            child.InnerText = txtAuthor.Text            newNode.AppendChild(child)            child = doc.CreateElement( Section )            child.InnerText = txtSection.Text            newNode.AppendChild(child)             add new node to users node            Usersnode.AppendChild(newNode)            m += 1        End If         save doc        doc.Save( data.xml )    End SubThanks  Was this answer helpful?
