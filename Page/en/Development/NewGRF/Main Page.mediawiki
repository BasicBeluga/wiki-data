== New Graphics Development ==

Ever since OpenTTD started, we've always been expanding the game and its rules whilst remaining faithful to its source - the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe. Many things have been done, both official and unofficial, from adding speed indicators to new stations. This new project takes OpenTTD even one step further - it does not only add new elements - it adds a whole new graphics engine. In New Graphics development (NewGFX) we aim to bring OpenTTD to a 32 bits graphics engine, allowing more detail and eye candy than before. By doing this, we hope to not just make it look better, but extending Transport Tycoon's name and gameplay to more people in an age where graphics have taken a front row seat.

For '''Graphics replacement''' help, please look into the TTDpatch forums for instructions on creating graphics in 8 bits to the TTD palette.
