It's recommended that a grf only provides a limited range of things at once.  E.g. only trains, only stations, only houses, only planes, only ships, only new objects, only rail types, etc.  
A specific exception is industries and cargos.  An industry newgrf should also provide cargos.  No other type of newgrf set should modify cargos, this causes numerous problems for players and other set authors.
Mixing trams and normal road vehicles is often acceptable, but consider if players would prefer separate tram and road vehicle sets.
If you do mix things in a set, provide parameters that allow players to turn groups of things on or off.

If your set is large and provides many vehicles or objects, consider identifying 'core' and 'extra' items, with parameters to turn them on or off.  Consider defaulting to 'off' for the extra items - this is useful to admins of multiplayer servers.

Use a compatibility check to identify incompatible grfs and display an informative message.

Never disable other grfs.  Instead disable your own, with a warning message.

If you use parameters, use action 14 so that OpenTTD can provide a GUI for them.

If a newer version of your grf is not savegame-compatible with an older version of your grf, use action 14 to provide a check.  Do not change the grfid to handle savegame compatibility unless you have a sound reason to do so (WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD REASON?).

Consider using the GPL or a CC license that allows others to modify and redistribute your work under certain conditions.  This makes it easier for others to collaborate with you, and means your grf can be maintained and updated in future.

Include a readme.txt with your set, unless it's so simple you don't need it.

When uploading to Bananas, try to provide a good description, as best as you can within the limited amount of text available.

If your set is GPL or similar and requires a licence.txt, make sure you include that with your grf in any tars / zips.

The light in original TTD graphics comes from the bottom right of the screen, and is best imagined as 'high up in the sky'.  Shadows fall towards the top-left of the screen.  There are tutorials and guides elsewhere that incorrectly say light comes from the right/top-right.  Some graphics deviate from this, if you wish to be compatible with TTD style, don't be mistaken about the lighting.

Sprite templates exist for trains (by pikka) and road vehicles (modified from pikka templates by andythenorth).  Using these templates will make your life easier.

If reusing assets from a GPL (or other freely licensed) set, it's nice to ask first, by forum pm or posting in the thread.  It's certainly not required, but it's considered a compliment :)
