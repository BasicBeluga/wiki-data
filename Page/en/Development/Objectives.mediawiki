[[Translation:en/Development/Objectives]]
==Objectives==
* Provide a free, open source, transport game
* Support all 'major' platforms, preferably supporting minor platforms too
* Provide a game that is free from war themes and conflict; hence suitable for all age groups

==Long term goals==
* Create a standalone game that does not require TTD GFX
** See [[en/Archive/Community/Graphics Replacement|graphics replacement project]] to see how that's progressing.
