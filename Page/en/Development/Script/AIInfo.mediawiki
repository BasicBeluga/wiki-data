'''info.nut''' is a file in which you tell NoAI basic things about your AI. It used to be part of <code>main.nut</code>, but it has been separated to make debugging easier ([[en/Archive/Development/AI Development milestones#20-may-2008-main-nut-is-split-in-two|see here]] if you're interested in details).

== info.nut structure ==

The internal structure of <code>info.nut</code> is very simple and follows a template presented below.

 class '''MyNewAI''' extends AIInfo {
   function GetAuthor()      { return "Newbie AI Writer"; }
   function GetName()        { return "MyNewAI"; }
   function GetDescription() { return "An example AI by following the tutorial at http://wiki.openttd.org/"; }
   function GetVersion()     { return 1; }
   function GetDate()        { return "2007-03-17"; }
   function CreateInstance() { return "MyNewAI"; }
 }
 
 /* Tell the core we are an AI */
 RegisterAI('''MyNewAI'''());

Where of course you should change the names however you like to call everything. Just don't forget the <code>RegisterAI()</code>, and don't forget to extend <code>AIInfo</code>. If something goes wrong, check if you did: <code>RegisterAI(MyNewAI())</code>. Mind the <code>()</code> after <code>MyNewAI</code>!
