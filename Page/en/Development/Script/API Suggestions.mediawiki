Here is a list of suggestions to extend/change the AI API before it becomes stable. The goal is to improve sustainability and to reduce the chance of needing to break the API in the future.

=== Vehicles ===

* Support for timetables. Yexo 21:38, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

* Rename AIOrder::ChangeOrder to AIOrder::ChangeOrderFlags.

=== AIAbstractList ===

* Create an enum for the second parameter to Sort (bool ascending).
** You can use this code as workaround (put in Start, before using it). You can now use AIAbstractList.SORT_ASCENDING and descending as if it was part of the api.
 AIAbstractList.SORT_ASCENDING <- true;
 AIAbstractList.SORT_DESCENDING <- false;
