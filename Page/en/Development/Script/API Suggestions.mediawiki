[[Translation:en/Development/Script/API Suggestions]]

Here is a list of suggestions to extend/change the AI API before it becomes stable. The goal is to improve sustainability and to reduce the chance of needing to break the API in the future.

=== Industries ===

* Usage of IndustrySpec should be minimised, as all of its members are potential candidates to vary between industries of the same type.
*: For AIIndustryType::GetProducedCargo and AIIndustryType::GetAcceptedCargo this is already the case. (See warning in API)
*: Those functions could be moved/copied to AIIndustry in addition to IsCargoAccepted. --Frosch 14:12, 24 January 2009 (UTC)

* AIIndustry::GetProduction is not very useful. (See warning in API) --Frosch 14:12, 24 January 2009 (UTC)

* AIIndustry::HasHeliportAndDock and AIIndustry::GetHeliportAndDockLocation might need splitting into separate functions for docks and heliport, as industries might restrict their availability. Also theoretically multiple stations per industry are already possible though unlikely used. --Frosch 14:12, 24 January 2009 (UTC)

=== Vehicles ===

* AIOrder needs to be extended so conditional orders become available for AIs. Yexo 20:41, 26 January 2009 (UTC)

* AIOrder needs support to detect shared vehicles and AIs need to be able to get a list of all vehicles that share orders. Yexo 12:19, 31 January 2009 (UTC)

=== Stations ===

* There needs to be some function to check the town which noise level will be increased by building an airport at some tile. Yexo 22:31, 26 January 2009 (UTC)

* Support for distant-join is missing. Though not very important, it might be a test-case for how to add new aspects to existing API functions in a nice way without breaking the existing AIs. --Frosch 17:59, 27 January 2009 (UTC)
