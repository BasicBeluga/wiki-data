Here is a list of suggestions to extend/change the AI API before it becomes stable. The goal is to improve sustainability and to reduce the change of a need to break the API in the future.

=== Industries ===

* Usage of IndustrySpec should be minimised, as all of its members are potential candidates to vary between industries of the same type.
*: For AIIndustryType::GetProducedCargo and AIIndustryType::GetAcceptedCargo this is already the case. (See warning in API)
*: Those functions could be moved/copied to AIIndustry in addition to IsCargoAccepted. --Frosch 14:12, 24 January 2009 (UTC)

* AIIndustry::GetProduction is not very useful. (See warning in API) --Frosch 14:12, 24 January 2009 (UTC)

* AIIndustry::HasHeliportAndDock and AIIndustry::GetHeliportAndDockLocation might need splitting into separate functions for docks and heliport, as industries might restrict their availability. Also theoretically multiple stations per industry are already possible though unlikely used. --Frosch 14:12, 24 January 2009 (UTC)
