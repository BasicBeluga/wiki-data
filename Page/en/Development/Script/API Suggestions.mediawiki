Here is a list of suggestions to extend/change the AI API before it becomes stable. The goal is to improve sustainability and to reduce the chance of needing to break the API in the future.

=== Industries ===

* Usage of IndustrySpec should be minimised, as all of its members are potential candidates to vary between industries of the same type.
*: For AIIndustryType::GetProducedCargo and AIIndustryType::GetAcceptedCargo this is already the case. (See warning in API)
*: Those functions could be moved/copied to AIIndustry in addition to IsCargoAccepted. --Frosch 14:12, 24 January 2009 (UTC)
*:: They are already available, but as seperate classes: AICargoList_IndustryAccepting and AICargoList_IndustryProducing. Yexo 00:30, 5 February 2009 (UTC)

* AIIndustry::GetProduction is not very useful. (See warning in API) --Frosch 14:12, 24 January 2009 (UTC)
*: Patch here: http://devs.openttd.org/~Yexo/ai_api/remove_industry_getproduction.diff Yexo 01:19, 5 February 2009 (UTC)

* AIIndustry::HasHeliportAndDock and AIIndustry::GetHeliportAndDockLocation might need splitting into separate functions for docks and heliport, as industries might restrict their availability. Also theoretically multiple stations per industry are already possible though unlikely used. --Frosch 14:12, 24 January 2009 (UTC)
*: Patch here: http://devs.openttd.org/~Yexo/ai_api/split_hasheliportanddock.diff Yexo 01:19, 5 February 2009 (UTC)

=== Vehicles ===

* AIOrder needs to be extended so conditional orders become available for AIs. Yexo 20:41, 26 January 2009 (UTC)

=== Stations ===

* Support for distant-join is missing. Though not very important, it might be a test-case for how to add new aspects to existing API functions in a nice way without breaking the existing AIs. --Frosch 17:59, 27 January 2009 (UTC)
*: Patch here: http://devs.openttd.org/~Yexo/ai_api/distant_join.diff
