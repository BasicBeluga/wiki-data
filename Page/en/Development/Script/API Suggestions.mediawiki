Here is a list of suggestions to extend/change the AI API before it becomes stable. The goal is to improve sustainability and to reduce the chance of needing to break the API in the future. If you miss any functions, please make a topic in the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=65 NoAI subforum].

=== Vehicles ===

* Support for timetables;
* Create a new vehicle State: VS_HEADING_DEPOT.
** Won't happen, you can check whether it's going to a depot via GetDestination(). Yexo 01:05, 18 March 2009 (UTC)

=== AITile ===
* PurchaseLand
** Won't happen. Yexo 01:05, 18 March 2009 (UTC)
*** Why?

=== AIAbstractList ===

* Create an enum for the second parameter to Sort (bool ascending).
** You can use this code as workaround (put in Start, before using it). You can now use AIAbstractList.SORT_ASCENDING and descending as if it was part of the api.
 AIAbstractList.SORT_ASCENDING <- true;
 AIAbstractList.SORT_DESCENDING <- false;
