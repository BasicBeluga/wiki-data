[[Translation:en/Development/Script/Last Error]]
OpenTTD is a realtime game, so no program can predict whether a certain planned action will fail or succeed until it has been executed. When letting AIs build bridges, vehicles, reroute aircraft chances are some of these commands will fail due to some reason or another. Aircraft can crash, more money may be required and other opponents might interfere with its plans. As of now NoAI can report whether a command has been executed successfully, but if a command has failed it can't report why it has failed. This page is as of now a WIP (Work In Progress), I'm writing a patch to enable AIs to retrieve the last error given by the last failed command.

== Code ==
Every error code in OpenTTD has its own ID (StringID) and is used to translate the error into one of the various languages to notify the user through a message on the GUI. In order to translate these errors we have to translate these StringIDs into error messages and expose them through the NoAI API. In the current patch the last error message can be acquired by calling AIError::GetLastError(), and error messages can be checked by:

 if (!AIAirport::BuildAirport(...)) {
   switch(AIError::GetLastError()) {
     case AIError::NOT_ENOUGH_CASH: // Get some more change
       ...
       break;
     case AIError::LOCAL_AUTHORITY_REFUSES: // Bribe!
       ...
       break;
     case AIAirport::LAND_SLOPES_IN_WRONG_DIRECTION: // Do some terraforming
       ...
       break;
     ...
     default:
       print("Unhandled exception: " + AIError::GetLastErrorString());
       break;
   }
 }

Internally error messages are mapped to both enum constants (like AIError::Not_ENOUGH_CASH) and a string representation. The string representation can be acquired by calling AIError::GetLastErrorString and will match with the name of the enum constant, note that this is meant to be used for debug purposes only! The API documentation will be updated such that each method will list all errors that can occur by invoking it.

== Patch ==
We're currently done with writing the back-end for this solution, see http://devs.openttd.org/~noai/morloth/patches/wip/awk.patch for the actual patch. The errors codes are directly loaded into SQ (thx for the suggestion TrueLight :)) so they don't clog the API. Work is now concentrated on writing and mapping all internal error messages to the error constants which will be published in the API. Current patch for the latter can be found here: http://devs.openttd.org/~noai/morloth/patches/wip/last_error.patch.

Disclaimer: This is still WIP (Work in progress), this page will be updated after the patches land on the branch.
