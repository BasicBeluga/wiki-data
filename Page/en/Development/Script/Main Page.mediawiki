[[Translation:en/Development/Script/Main Page]]
Welcome to the AI Development. Starting from the NoAI branch it is possible for any user to create his own AI. Not only do we deliver a clean and simple API, we also allow you to make your AI in scripts. This should make it possible for anyone with a bit programming knowledge to make pretty good AIs. Also should it challenge people to build better AIs then the ones we currently have in 0.5 release. This page is all about telling you how to do it.

For all pages there is the rule: where examples are given, we will use Squirrel. We suggest everyone who wants to write an AI to read the Introduction as it will explain the basic concept.
