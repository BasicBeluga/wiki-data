Script Communication Protocol (SCP) a protocol for AIs and Game Scripts to communicate with each other. 

== The protocol ==
The idea is that AI and Goal scripts communicate using signs placed in a pre-defined tile in one of the map corners. For now we will refer to this as the 'communication tile'. 

An AI that want to query the Game Script something, place a sign at the communication tile. The NoGo will periodically scan the signs of all companies to see if there are any signs on the communication tile and process those. If a question from a company is found, a response sign will be created using that company ID so that the AI of that company can read it.

For more details on the protocol, see [http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/scriptlib-scp/repository/entry/protocol.txt protocol.txt]

== SCP Library ==
To ease the usage of this protocol, there is a AI and GS library that allows sending commands between Game Scripts and AIs and handling all the low-level stuff of encoding the data into signs and decoding the signs.

=== Command Sets ===
A command set, is a set of commands that could vaguely correspond to the commands supported by a specific GameScript. However, the idea behind command sets is that if there is one Game Script providing town goals and another providing economical goals, it should be possible to combine those two in a single Game Script without the AI needing to be changed as long as the AI support both the command set "Bobs Economy set" and "Alice Town Set".
