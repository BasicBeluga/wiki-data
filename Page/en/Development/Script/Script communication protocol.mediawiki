Script Communication Protocol (SCP) a protocol for AIs and Game Scripts to communicate with each other. 

== Introduction ==
The idea is that AI and Goal scripts communicate using signs placed in a pre-defined tile in one of the map corners. For now we will refer to this as the 'communication tile'. 

An AI that want to query the Game Script something, place a sign at the communication tile. The NoGo will periodically scan the signs of all companies to see if there are any signs on the communication tile and process those. If a question from a company is found, a response sign will be created using that company ID so that the AI of that company can read it.

For more details on the protocol, see [http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/scriptlib-scp/repository/entry/protocol.txt protocol.txt]

== SCP Library ==
To ease the usage of this protocol, there is a AI and GS library that allows sending commands between Game Scripts and AIs and handling all the low-level stuff of encoding the data into signs and decoding the signs.
