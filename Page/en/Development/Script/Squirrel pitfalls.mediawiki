===require()===

To include files inside your main.nut, you can use require(). Require() works relative from the current file, so it should be easy to use. But, there are several things you have to keep in mind:

* It always includes the file in the global space. It isn't a code-include. So the file included has to be full code (rarely people will notice this, but it is important to know :))
* Try to avoid require() on the root-level of main.nut. So try to do it in a function, in Start() for example sounds like a good idea. When OpenTTD starts up, it runs all main.nuts, and the AIFactory in it. Any require() it comes across on root-level, it includes too. This is a big slowdown, as it is never used (when starting an AI, the file is loaded AGAIN). So put the requires in Start() or where ever when possible, and only just before you start using it. This is a big speed-up.
