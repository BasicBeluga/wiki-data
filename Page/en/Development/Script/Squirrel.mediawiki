== Converted Squirrel Functions ==

Some of the basic functions are included from the Squirrel framework but may differ. Anything not explitly mentioned here or in the AI documentation may not work. These are:

=== abs ===

abs() returns the absolute value of an input number. Eg:

 print("abs(-5) is:" + abs(-5));
 abs(-5) is: 5

=== require ===

Replaces dofile(), and loads a new .nut file. The path is relative, and will load the code from that file immediately.

 require("test.nut");
