To view the core Squirrel documentation, download or view the [http://squirrel-lang.org/#doc Documentation], although the standard libraries are not enabled.

== Converted Squirrel Functions ==

Some of the basic functions are included from the Squirrel framework but may differ. Anything not explitly mentioned here or in the AI documentation may not work. These are:

=== print ===

Avoid using. Rather use [http://devs.openttd.org/~noai/aidocs/classAILog.html AILog::Info()] or [http://devs.openttd.org/~noai/aidocs/classAILog.html AILog::Warning()] to send messages. They are captured nicely and printed in the AI Debug Window (as well as all normal debug outputs).

=== abs ===

abs() returns the absolute value of an integer/float value. For example:

 print("abs(-5) is: " + abs(-5));

Will print:

 abs(-5) is: 5

=== require ===

Includes a snippet of code from an other file. The path is relative, and will load the code from that file immediately. Every file needs to be compilable on its own, keep that in mind.

 require("test.nut");
