Some examples of the Squirrel markup are found on the [http://squirrel-lang.org/ Squirrel Language Website].

To view the core Squirrel documentation, download or view the [http://squirrel-lang.org/#doc Documentation], although the standard libraries are not enabled.

== Converted Squirrel Functions ==

Some of the basic functions are included from the Squirrel framework but may differ. Anything not explitly mentioned here or in the AI documentation may not work. These are:

=== print ===

Does the same output as long as the [[en/Development/Script/Need To Know#developer-console-usage|console output is enabled]]:

 print("Hello");
 Hello

It'd be more wise to make use of [http://devs.openttd.org/~noai/aidocs/classAILog.html AILog:XXX()] to output specific levels of debug messages. print() doesn't go to the AI Debug Console either.

=== abs ===

abs() returns the absolute value of an input number. Eg:

 print("abs(-5) is: " + abs(-5));
 abs(-5) is: 5

=== require ===

Replaces dofile(), and loads a new .nut file. The path is relative, and will load the code from that file immediately.

 require("test.nut");

''To be completed...''
