OpenTTD 14+ contains a plugin system to integrate with Social Platforms (like Steam, Discord, GOG, ...).

The interface of this plugin is defined in "src/3rdparty/openttd_social_integration_api/openttd_social_integration_api.h" in OpenTTD's source repository.

To keep the Social Platform naming aligned, if you create your own plugin, please follow these names (including capitalization) to put in "social_platform". Feel free to extend this list if you integrate with new platforms.
