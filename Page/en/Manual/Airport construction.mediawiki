==My trains are making a ton of profit why build anything else?==
While trains are the backbone of your company, [[en/Manual/Aircraft]] and [[en/Manual/Aircraft|helicopters]] for that matter are just way too cool not to build them. Besides the fact that they are fast, they can make a lot of profit, passangers love them and they cannot be sabotaged. Before building [[en/Manual/Aircraft]] you of course need an airport.

==Constructing airports==
You can start constructing by pressing the airport build button on the [[en/In Game Interface|menu bar]]. Once clicked the Airport construction window pops up (picture 2).

==What do all those buttons do?==
The buttons are selfexplanatory. From left to right:<br>
:*'''Airport Construction Button''': Opens the airport selection window for you to choose an airport type to build.
:*'''[[en/Clear Tile]] Button'''
:*'''[[en/Lower Land]] Button'''
:*'''[[en/Raise Land]] Button'''
:*'''[[en/Place Sign]] Button'''

==Airport selection window. What airports can I choose from?==
As time progresses you will have more and more airports to choose from. In the early years the selection is rather limited. Once you have made your choice find a ((building stations|suiteable place)) for your airport, and place it.

:*All aircraft can land here, but jets may crash frequently while landing '''(*)'''
:*The airport has a small capacity and gets congested very easily

Notes:
:*All aircraft can land here without crashing '''(*)'''
:*The airport doesn't get congested because aircraft land and take off from different sides of the airport and they wait in seperate hangars. Also the terminals are split up into two sections so if one section does get clogged up and there are spaces free at the other one, aircraft can go there. A must for the rich conglomerate!

:*Only helicopter can land here, and only 1 at a time


'''(*)''' <warning>There is still of course the ineviteable occasional crashing</warning>
