[[Translation:en/Manual/Airport construction]]
When joining towns or cities across a very long distance, [[en/Manual/Aircraft]] will be helpful. Airports are needed for them to land on.

==Constructing airports==
You can start constructing by pressing the airport build button [[File:en/Manual/Manual html 1ae92703.png]] on the [[en/Manual/Game interface|menu bar]]. Once clicked the Airport construction window [[File:en/Manual/Airport construction.png]] pops up.

==What do all those buttons do?==
The buttons are self-explanatory. From left to right:<br>
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build airport.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Airports|airport]] button''': Opens the airport selection window for you to choose an airport type to build.
:*[[File:en/Manual/Clear title.png]] '''[[en/Manual/Landscaping|Clear land]] button'''
From 0.3.4:
:*[[File:en/Landscape button.png]] '''[[en/Manual/Landscaping]] Toolbar button'''

Before 0.3.4:
:*[[File:en/Manual/Lower land.png]] '''[[en/Manual/Landscaping|Lower land]] button'''
:*[[File:en/Manual/Raise land.png]] '''[[en/Manual/Landscaping|Raise land]] button'''
:*[[File:en/Manual/Buy land.png]] '''Buy [[en/Manual/Land|land]] button'''

==Airport selection window. What airports can I choose from?==
As time progresses you will have more and more airports to choose from. In the early years the selection is rather limited. Once you have made your choice find a [[en/Manual/Stations|suitable place]] for your airport, and place it. There is a total of four different [[en/Manual/Airports]] and one heliport ([[en/Manual/Airports|airport types in detail]]).

==Building Aircraft==
Once your airport has been built, you can build planes. To do this, click on one of the aircraft [[en/Manual/Depots]] to bring up the hangar window. Then select "Build new vehicles". A new window should pop up with a list of different aircraft to purchase. Select one you think will be necessary, and then press "Buy Vehicle" at the bottom of this window. The plane will then appear in one of the slots in the depot window and a window will pop up. Give it [[en/Manual/Orders]] or [[en/Manual/Refit]] it as necessary, and then click on the red "Stopped" text to start it!
