==My trains are making a ton of profit why build anything else?==
While trains are the backbone of your company, [[en/Manual/Aircraft]] and [[en/Manual/Aircraft|helicopters]] for that matter are just way too cool not to build them. Besides the fact that they are fast, they can make a lot of profit, passengers love them and they cannot be sabotaged. Before building [[en/Manual/Aircraft]] you of course need an airport.

==Constructing airports==
You can start constructing by pressing the airport build button [[File:en/Manual/Manual html 1ae92703.png]] on the [[en/Manual/Game interface|menu bar]]. Once clicked the Airport construction window pops up (Fig 1).

==Airport selection window. What airports can I choose from?==
As time progresses you will have more and more airports to choose from. In the early years the selection is rather limited. Once you have made your choice find a [[en/Building stations|suitable place]] for your airport, and place it. There is a total of four different [[en/Manual/Airports]] and one heliport ([[en/Manual/Airports|airport types in detail]]).
