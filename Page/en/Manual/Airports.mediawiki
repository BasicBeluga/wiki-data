Airports are the [[en/Manual/Stations]] for [[en/Manual/Aircraft#aircraft|airplanes]] and [[en/Manual/Aircraft#helicopters|helicopters]]. They can also contain a hangar in which airplanes and helicopters can be built and serviced. For the different types of airports, see below.

To learn how to build and manage airports, see [[en/Manual/Airport construction]].

=Small airports=

==Small==
{{en/Manual/Airport|Fullname=Small Airport|image=en/[[en/Image/airport s.png|thumb|300px|left|the small airport in openttd]]|Entry=|Runways=1|Ramps=2|Heli=1 (at terminals)|size=3 x 4|hangars=1|catchment=4|noise=3}}

Small airports are the smallest type of airport in OpenTTD. Although they played a more prominent role in the original Transport Tycoon, Transport Tycoon Deluxe and OpenTTD still include them. The airport can service two air vehicles at a time, including helicopters as the airport has one helipad. The small airport is prone to traffic problems because planes must use the runway as a taxiway between the loading zones and the hangar, and to taxi into place after landing and before takeoff.

This Airport can also be a victim of the dreaded Zeppelin [[en/Manual/Disasters]] that can happen in the early parts of the game. Also, jet planes are very prone to crashing on this type of airport due to its small runway.

==Commuter==
{{en/Manual/Airport|Fullname=Commuter Airport|image=en/[[en/Image/Commuterairport.png|thumb|250px|left|the new commuter airport]]|Entry=1983|Runways=1|Ramps=3|Heli=2|size=4 x 5|hangars=1|catchment=4|noise=4}}

The Commuter airport is a new airport designed to hold a small amount of planes for unloading and loading inside cities. Although larger and superior to the Small airport, the faster planes may crash on landing due to the smaller runway. Throughput is greater than the City Airport have due to shorter taxiing times, and throughput of two commuter airports is greater than the International Airport have.

It also utilises the graphics the later airports use, so it is a fitting upgrade to small airports with old planes well into the late game stages. This airport has a footprint of 4x5, and has three loading pads with two helipads.

=Large airports=

==City==
{{en/Manual/Airport|Fullname=City Airport|image=en/[[en/Image/airport c.png|thumb|300px|right|the city airport in openttd]]|Entry=1955|Runways=1|Ramps=3|Heli=1 (at terminals)|size=6 x 6|hangars=1|catchment=5|noise=5}}

The city airport (called the Large Airport in original TTD) is one step up from the small airport. It has three loading/unloading bays for aircraft, and one runway. It can handle a decent amount of traffic, but as there is only one runway, the amount of planes processed drops steeply, as planes go to wait in the hangar and cannot leave again due to the traffic.

This airport is the first airport available that can handle jet aircraft, most notably the FFP Dart/Aerospatialle Caravelle. However, as a result, the airport's footprint is increased, as the runway needs to be larger. This airport can also have a plane land and a helicopter land simultaneously, as the helipad is not located on the runway, but at the intersection of the taxiways.

==Metropolitan airport==
{{en/Manual/Airport|Fullname=Metropolitan Airport|image=en/[[en/Image/airport m.png|thumb|300px|right|the metropolitan airport in openttd]]|Entry=1980|Runways=2|Ramps=3|Heli=1 (at terminals)|size=6 x 6|hangars=1|catchment=6}}

This is an improved version of the City Airport, and is different in that it has two runways (one for landing aircraft and one for those taking off) so that it can handle more traffic. Also the catchment area is slightly greater. All other features are the same.

This airport can handle much more traffic than the City Airport, but is still inferior to the international airport, as planes that have landed must cross runway two to get to the terminal. This affects planes taking off, and can cause a backup of traffic.

==International airport==
{{en/Manual/Airport|Fullname=International Airport|image=en/[[en/Image/airport i.png|thumb|300px|right|the international airport in openttd]]|Entry=1990|Runways=2|Ramps=6|Heli=2|size=7 x 7|hangars=2|catchment=8}}

The International airport is the second-largest airport in OpenTTD. It has two runways, like the Metropolitan Airport, but each runway is on the opposite side of the airport so that planes that are arriving/leaving do not obstruct one another. The terminal can handle up to six planes loading or unloading at once. The airport also has two hangars, so that more planes can be serviced. Three helicopters can land simultaneously, while only two helicopters can load/unload at once.

This airport requires a serious amount of traffic to block, but it can still happen with a lot of traffic, with planes having difficulty moving around the airport, as well as difficulty landing. As a result of this, it is expected higher capacity airports will be introduced within the foreseeable future.

==Intercontinental==
{{en/Manual/Airport|Fullname=Intercontinental Airport|image=en/[[en/Image/Intercontinentalairport.png|thumb|300px|right|the new intercontinental airport]]|Entry=2002|Runways=4 (two takeoff, two landing)|Ramps=8|Heli=2|size=11 x 9|hangars=2|catchment=10}}

The Intercontinental Airport is now OpenTTD's largest airport. Boasting 4 runways, and an overall footprint of 9x11, it easily dwarfs the International airport. Designed to be the hub of airport services, the airport can have two planes take off and two planes land at any time. However, it retains two helipads, and can still clog at high traffic.

All planes can land at this airport with a low risk of crashing, but that risk is still present. This airport has eight terminals for loading, and two hangars. Aircraft will usually take off from the same side they landed, but can change, depending on how full the terminals are.

=Helicopter airports=

==Heliport==
{{en/Manual/Airport|Fullname=Heliport|image=en/[[en/Image/Heliport.png|right|thumb|the original heliport]]|Entry=1963|Runways=N/A|Ramps=N/A|Heli=1|size=1 x 1|hangars=N/A|catchment=4}}

Only helicopters can land at a heliport and only 1 helicopter at a time can load or unload (like with the Small Airport). The heliport occupies only 1 tile, so it is very convenient for use inside a crowded city. The heliport is one of the three original airports in the original TTD, introduced for helicopters to load and unload inside cities.

==Helistation==
{{en/Manual/Airport|Fullname=Helistation|image=en/[[en/Image/Helistation.png|thumb|right|the new helistation]]|Entry=1980|Runways=N/A|Ramps=N/A|Heli=3|size=2 x 4|hangars=1|catchment=4}}

The Helistation, quite simply, is a larger version of the Helidepot, with three helipads instead of one.

==Helidepot==
{{en/Manual/Airport|Fullname=Helidepot|image=en/[[en/Image/Helidepot.png|thumb|left|the new helidepot]]|Entry=1976|Runways=N/A|Ramps=N/A|Heli=1|size=2 x 2|hangars=1|catchment=4}}

The Helidepot is similar to a heliport, except it is not a tall building, but more like an airport. It also has one hangar, making this suitable for placing inside cities, and removes the need to build an airport for a simple helicopter route.

=Crash landing=
Airplanes have a small chance (0.07%) of crashing each time they land at an airport. Big planes have a high chance (5%) to crash in ''small'' or ''commuter'' airports.  Keep this in mind when building small airports!

See the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Aircraft/Air Comparison|air comparison]] table for a list of "small" airplanes that can be safely landed in small airports.
