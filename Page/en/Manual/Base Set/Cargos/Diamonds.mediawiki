Diamonds is only available in the sub-tropical climate. It is produced by gold-mines and must be transported to banks. In the sub-tropical climate the banks do not produce valuable-bags.

== Strategies ==
Maybe it is a good strategy to transport diamonds by airplane. Airplanes are really fast and so the payment rate is high. But you will need big airplanes to do so, at least airplanes for 150 passengers. The banks are located in towns, so it may be difficult to build an airport near them.

Using feeder systems can solve this problem. The airports near the towns can be used by both gold-transports and passanger-services, if they have enough capacity.

Only two airports are allowed per town. This means, if you build many airports near diamonds-mines and banks your competitors cannot build so many airports. So on maps with few towns, this prevents them from creating many airlines.
