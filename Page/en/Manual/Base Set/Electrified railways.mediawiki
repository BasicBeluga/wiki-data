'''Electrified Rails''' are a new feature to [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/OpenTTD 0.5.0]] which allow electrically powered train engines to only run on electrified track.

The toolbar for building Electrified rails is found under the [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] build railway menu item and is the second option.

The only trains electrified by default in OpenTTD are the following:
*[[File:en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/Sh30.png|SH "30" Engine]] [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/SH '30']]
*[[File:en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/Sh40.png|SH "40" Engine]] [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/SH '40']]
*[[File:en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/Tim.png|"T.I.M" Engine]] [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/T.I.M.]]
*[[File:en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/Asiastar.png|"Asiastar" Engine]] [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/AsiaStar]]

For these trains to operate, you must construct an electrified train [[en/Manual/Depots]], [[en/Manual/Convert rail|convert]] your railways to electrified and then purchase a train as usual. Carriages and wagons can be used on either of the types.

Electrified railways can be built as normal track is, and can also be intersected with normal track. However, electrified trains will not travel onto the normal track. Normal track can be converted to electrified track via the [[en/Manual/Convert rail|convert rail]] tool.
