The '''Bank''' is a two-tile industry always located in [[en/Manual/Towns]]. The temperate banks never appear on a newly generated map, but spawn in suitable towns during the game (in any year). The sub-arctic and sub-tropical banks are available from the start.

The main difference besides appearance is that the temperate bank produces the resources it also can accept, while the sub-arctic/sub-tropic version only accepts materials.

Banks never close down; they stay on the map forever. Temperate banks never increase or decrease production of valuables (except for the change between 8 and 9 deliveries per month; see [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page]]).

==Funding a bank==
Funding a bank is possible when the appropriate [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Economy#manual-primary-industry-construction-method|advanced setting]] is enabled. You can only fund banks if population of the town is at least 1200. The cursor will indicate the upper right corner of the 2x1 squares that the bank will occupy. The complete footprint needs to be on top of house(s).
