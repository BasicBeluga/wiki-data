The '''Forest''' in OpenTTD is a plantation of pine trees used for making either timber products or paper (in the Temperate and Sub-Arctic climates respectively).  The trees are automatically replanted by the forestry staff ensuring a continuous supply of [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Wood]] for you to transport.

Forests are not available in the Sub-Tropical climate since pine trees are not suited to it.
