The '''Oil Rig''' produces [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Oil]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Passengers]], the latter one is also accepted as cargo. Being the only industry (not counting game-changing [[en/Manual/NewGRF|NewGRFs]]) that is constructed entirely on water, it is also ''only'' found in the temperate climate.

Another specialty about the Oil Rig is that it is a neutral station complete with built-in [[en/Manual/Water Transport Tiles|dock]] for [[en/Manual/Ships|ships]] and helipad for [[en/Manual/Aircraft|helicopters]]. Every [[en/Manual/Transport company|company]] can transport to and from these facilities as soon as its construction is finished.
