A '''water tower''' is an [[en/Manual/Industries|Industry]] that only appears in the [[en/Manual/Climates#sub-tropical|sub-tropical]] climate. It accepts [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Water]] but does not produce any cargo. Water towers can only be built on desert tiles within a [[en/Manual/Towns|town]].

Unlike [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Food|food]] produced by [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Food Processing Plant|food processing plants]] which has to be imported like conventional [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Goods|goods]], the water tower has to be in the catchment area of a station to accept the resource. It is one of the resources required for the growth of a city located in a desert area.
