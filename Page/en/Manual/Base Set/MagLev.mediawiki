[[Translation:en/Manual/Base Set/MagLev]]
'''Maglevs''' are the found under the build railway tool bar and are the last to be available to build.  

These tracks support only the Maglev specific powered vehicles. Maglev is english abbreviation for "magnetic levitation", which is an existing (thought not really worldwide used) technology. This technology makes possible to make train levitate (= hover, stay in air). Because there is literally zero friction between train and it's tracks, train and its carriages goes very fast. (Real world tests gave maximally about 500 kph (311 mph)).

Neither one of maglevs in OpenTDD has a real-life relative, they are a pure fantasy.
