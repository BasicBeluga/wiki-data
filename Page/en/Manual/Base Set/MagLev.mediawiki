'''MagLev''' is the English abbreviation for "magnetic levitation", which is an existing (thought not really worldwide used) technology. This technology makes possible to make [[en/Manual/Trains]]s levitate (that is, to hover, or stay in the air). Because there is literally zero friction between train and its tracks, the train and its carriages move very fast. (Real world tests gave maximally about 500 kph / 311 mph).

In game first Maglev train (Lev1 'Leviathan' or Wizzowow Rocketeer) is available in 2022.

The toolbar for building MagLevs is found under the [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] build railway menu item and are the last to be available to build. These tracks support only the MagLev specific vehicles.

There are the four following Maglev trains available in Temperate, Sub-Arctic and Tropical climates:

And one train in Toyland landscape:

None of the MagLev vehicles in OpenTDD has a real-life relative, they are a pure fantasy.
