[[Translation:en/Manual/Base Set/Road Vehicles/Armoured Trucks]]
NOTE: These vehicles perform a different function in each climate. In "temperate" they transport valuables between banks (which are built in cities of over 1,200 population). In "sub-arctic", they carry gold from gold mines to banks(no population requirements here). Finally, in "tropical" climate, they carry diamonds from diamond mines to banks. Oh yes, apart from the type of cargo, the statistics remain the same.
