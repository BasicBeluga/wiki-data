==Overview==

The Dash DMU is a Diesel Multiple unit that by default comes with two units and carries passengers in much the same way as the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/Manley-Morel DMU]], albeit with slightly higher speed, power and capacity.

==History==

Part of a second dieselisation programme, the Class 156 'Sprinter' (Hence the name 'Dash') was introduced in the very early nineties to replace the earlier generation of DMU (such as the aging Metro-Cammell). The mainstay of the British 'Regional Railways' local railways, these machines are still reliable units today.

==Tips==
These trains are really only suitable for light passenger transport, as they lack the power to transport heavier goods and pull more carriages.  You could add more units to increase the power and capacity (in true DMU style), but you are still limited to 75mph, so a better option would be to use [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/SH '125']] on the busier routers or even the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/T.I.M.]] when it is invented.  

A word of warning; when faster trains arrive on a large network, you may find that they get stuck behind these slower units slowing the whole network down, so you should either upgrade the whole lot, keep the DMUs on a separate section of track, or build [[en/Community/Double-Tracks]].
