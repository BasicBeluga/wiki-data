[[Translation:en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/Manley-Morel DMU]]
The Transport Tycoon name for the Metro-Cammell Class 101 DMU introduced as part of the 1956 British Railways Modernisation programme, designed to replace steam locomotives on local and semi-express lines. Unbelievably, despite the TTD '15 year' life span, these machines are still seen plodding around the British countryside!
