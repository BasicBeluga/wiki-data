==Overview==

The Manley-Morel DMU is a Diesel Multiple unit that by default comes with two units and carries passengers.

==History==

The Transport Tycoon name for the Metro-Cammell Class 101 DMU introduced as part of the 1956 British Railways Modernisation programme, designed to replace steam locomotives on local and semi-express lines. Unbelievably, despite the TTD '15 year' life span, these machines are still seen plodding around the British countryside!

==Advice==
These trains are really only suitable for light passenger transport, as they lack the power to transport heavier goods and pull more carriages.  You could add more units to increase the power and capacity (in true DMU style), but you are still limited to 70mph, so a better option would be to wait for the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/SH '125']] to come in in 1977 and use that.  

A word of warning though, when faster trains arrive on a large network, you may find that they get stuck behind these slower units slowing the whole network down, so you should either upgrade the whole lot, keep the DMUs on a separate section of track, or build [[en/Community/Double-Tracks]].

This train is made obsolete by the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/Dash]] which is introduced in 1984, but this is only 5mph faster and 100hp more powerful so really isn't much of an improvement - you are likely to have upgraded most major routes to SH '125's by then anyway.
