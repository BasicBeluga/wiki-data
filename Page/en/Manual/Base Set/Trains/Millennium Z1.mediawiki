|Description=Brilliant for high-capacity passenger routes. It also looks very swish with a rake of monorail passenger carriages.
|Real-life=The Millennium Z1 train seems to resemble the German "Transrapid" high speed monorail/maglev hybrid train in that both are high speed multiple units primarily aimed at passenger transit. Although TT only appeared in 1995, eerily enough, Transrapid came into commercial use, albeit in a limited form, in late 2004 - rather similar to its service date in game, and was in development when TT first appeared.
