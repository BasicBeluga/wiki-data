==Description==

Renamed version of the British Intercity 125, the record-holder for the fastest diesel locomotive in the world (125 MPH).

In OpenTTD, selecting this engine adds a driving-van trailer at the end of the train as well as the locomotive. Both the locomotive and trailer can contain extra cargo, by default mail. Don't forget to refit this vehicle to passengers if you run a passenger-only service, so your stations don't start gathering mail!
