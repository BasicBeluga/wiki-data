|Real-life=The SH "30" was really the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_86 BR Class "86"], an electric locomotive capable of speeds of up to 100mph. Primarily designed to pull expresses up and down the West Coast Mail Line in Britain.  Like the Metro-Cammell DMU these machines date from the early 1960's and the original West Coast Line Electrification scheme. Incredibly, some are still used today to pull the occasional train on the West Coast Line, and used more so in East Anglia.
