When you encounter an obstacle, building a bridge might be a good solution. You can use them to build your railroad over a competitor's tracks, to make your [[en/Manual/Road vehicles]] cross lakes or to create crossover-free highly optimized [[en/Community/Junctionary/Main Page]].

==Building Bridges for Beginners==
This mini-tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge of some of the menus in OpenTTD. If you don't think you do, you can take a quick review of the game interface [[en/Manual/Game interface|here]]. Well! Let's begin. Start by opening up the build toolbar for railways and clicking on [[File:en/Manual/Build bridge.png]] (build bridges button). You'll notice that your cursor will change:
<center>[[File:en/Ottdbridge1.png|center|frame|1. See the build bridges cursor?]]</center>
This of course, is anticipated and tells you that you are in fact (presuming you have the money) ready to build bridges. Next you have to recognize where you can build bridges. We'll start off with a standard bridge-the-gap bridge, which can be placed in an area that looks like this:
<center>[[File:en/Ottdbridge1.6.png|center|frame|2. What a nice place for a bridge!]]</center>
Now, when you move your mouse over the ground, you'll see that the square the mouse is in is highlighted, this is simply to clarify where the bridge will start.
<center>[[File:en/Ottdbridge2.png|center|frame|3. See it highlighted there?]]</center>
Now, just click, hold down, and drag in a south-east direction to the opposite raised tile, like so:
<center>[[File:en/Ottdbridge3.png|center|frame|4. Remember, you're still holding the mouse button down...]]</center>
And now, once you've dragged there, where you want the bridge to be, you can let go of that mouse button, and you get this dialog. The options will vary depending on the length and the year, and more information on these is available in the next section.
<center>[[File:en/Ottdbridge4.png|center|frame|5. You can choose which bridge you want.]]</center>
You can now click the bridge you want, we'll select Steel Girder this time:
<center>[[File:en/Ottdbridge5.png|center|frame|6. Bridge chosen...]]</center>
And... There you go, your (I suppose) very first bridge. You'll notice the red text rising -standard for any building operation that costs you money- displaying the amount of money you've spent.
<center>[[File:en/Ottdbridge6.png|center|frame|7. That cost you 579 pounds!]]</center>
Now, this works the same way for road construction as well, just select the bridge construction tool from the road construction tool bar.
<center>[[File:en/Ottdbridge1.5.png|center|frame|8. Hey! The build bridges cursor again!]]</center>
Now, repeat those drag & drop steps, and voila! Another bridge! For road vehicles this time!
<center>[[File:en/Ottdbridge7.png|center|frame|9. A road vehicle bridge next to the old one! And it costs!]]</center>
Now we've got making bridges down, there are a few more things that you can do... Bridges can only have one side sloped, like this:
<center>[[File:en/Ottdbridge8.png|center|frame|10. I'm sure you can picture how this comes out!]]</center>
Or, you can even do something like the following if the mind takes you. I'm not saying it's useful, but it's there.
<center>[[File:en/Ottdbridge9.png|center|frame|11. Not really useful, but...]]</center>
Bridges can be even constructed on flat land - say to avoid a track built by competition - Joeprusa.
<center>[[File:en/Ottdbridge10.png|center|frame|12. Completely flat...]]</center>
<center>[[File:en/Ottdbridge11.png|center|frame|13. ...and here's the bridge.]]</center>
And if you want more examples you can look at the different [[en/Manual/Base Set/Bridge types]]. I should mention that you can only build regular and unmodified rail/road/canal tiles under bridges. Well, I hope this has gotten you started with building your bridges, and happy transporting- Guru3.

== What bridges do you want? ==

There are 13 [[en/Manual/Base Set/Bridge types|bridge types]] ([[en/Manual/Base Set/Bridge types|Bridge types in detail]]) in OpenTTD. The number one rule is to stay away from the wooden bridges. They significantly slow even the earliest vehicles down. In the start, when money may be short, you want to buy the bridges that go as fast as the fastest road-vehicle at the time. Bridges are not very expensive, but in the start they may be out of reach. When you get richer, with a steady stream of cash rolling in, always go for the fastest, most expensive bridge you can afford.
