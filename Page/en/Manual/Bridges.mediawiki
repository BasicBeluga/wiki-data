When you encounter an obstacle, building a bridge might be a good solution. You can use them to build your railroad over a competitor's tracks, to make your [[en/Manual/Road vehicles|road vehicles]] cross lakes or to create crossover-free highly optimized [[en/Community/Junctionary/Main Page]].

==Building bridges for beginners==
Start by opening up the build toolbar for railways and clicking on [[File:en/Manual/Build bridge.png]] (build bridges button). You'll notice that your cursor will change:
[[File:en/Ottdbridge1.png|none|frame|See the build bridges cursor?]]
Next you have to recognize where you can build bridges. We'll start off with a standard bridge-the-gap bridge, which can be placed in an area that looks like this:
[[File:en/Ottdbridge1.6.png|none|frame|What a nice place for a bridge!]]
When you move your mouse over the ground, the square the mouse is in is highlighted; the bridge will start here.

Now, just click, hold down, and drag to the opposite sloped tile, like so:
[[File:en/Ottdbridge3.png|none|frame|4. Remember, you're still holding the mouse button down...]]
Once you've dragged there, where you want the bridge to be, let go of the mouse button. The bridge selection dialog will open. The options will vary depending on the bridge length and the year.

Click the bridge you want, we'll select Steel Girder this time:

And... there you go, your (I suppose) very first bridge. You'll notice the red text rising, displaying the amount of money you've spent.

This works the same way for road construction as well; just select the bridge construction tool from the road construction tool bar.

Now we've got making bridges down, there are a few more things that you can do. Bridges can be even constructed on flat land - say to avoid a track built by competition.

Or, you can even do something like the following if the mind takes you.

You can only build regular and unmodified rail/road/canal tiles under bridges, and only build bridges above those tiles.
