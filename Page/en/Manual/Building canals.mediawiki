Sometimes you want a ship to go where there's no water. Maybe an [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Oil Refinery]] is located too far inland for a dock to accept oil, or some mountains are forcing your ships to make large detours.

Either way, a canal is what you need. Canals allow you to place water at any flat tile of land on the map, even if that tile is located above sea level.
A lock is used to allow ships to "climb hills": a lock connects two bodies of water at different height levels. Please note that canals and locks are very expensive. Make sure to have enough money before building a canal.

==Building canals==
 
'''1.''' Open the ''Waterways construction'' toolbar by clicking the [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m2cc0c4cd.png]] button.
[[File:en/Manual/Dock toolbar.png|frame|none|The Waterways construction toolbar]]

'''2.''' Click on the ''Build canal'' button [[File:en/Manual/Build canal.png]]. Remember, you can right click on any button if you ever want a description of what it does.

'''3.''' Place the cursor on any flat tile of land and then left-click to place the canal tile. You can also click and drag to place longer stretches of canal.

Once the canal is built, it's time to connect it to a lower level of water using locks.


==Building locks==

'''1.''' Open the ''Waterways construction'' toolbar by clicking the [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m2cc0c4cd.png]] button.
[[File:en/Manual/Dock toolbar.png|frame|none|The Waterways construction toolbar]]

'''2.''' Click on the ''Build lock'' button [[File:en/Manual/Build locks.png]].

'''3.''' Now find a suitable location for the lock. A lock requires two full flat tiles connected by a single slope.

'''4.''' Click on the slope to build the lock.

'''5.''' Repeat steps 3 and 4 to place more locks if necessary.


==Aqueducts==

''Aqueducts'' are "bridges for boats". How to build bridges and aqueducts is covered in [[en/Manual/Building bridges]].
