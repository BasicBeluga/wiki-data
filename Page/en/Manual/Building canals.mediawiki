Sometimes you want a ship to go where there's no water. Maybe an [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Oil Refinery]] is located too far inland for a dock to accept oil, or some mountains are forcing your ships to make large detours.

Either way, a canal is what you need. Canals allow you to place water at any flat tile of land on the map, even if that tile is located above sea level.

A lock is used to allow ships to "climb hills": a lock connects two bodies of water at different height levels. Please note that canals and locks are very expensive. Make sure to have enough money before building a canal.

==Building canals==
# Open the ''Waterways construction'' toolbar by clicking the [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m2cc0c4cd.png]] button.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Dock toolbar.png|frame|none|The Waterways construction toolbar.]]
# Click on the ''Build canal'' button [[File:en/Manual/Build canal.png]]. Remember, you can right click on any button if you ever want a description of what it does.
# Place the cursor on any flat tile of land and then left-click to place the canal tile. You can also click and drag to place longer stretches of canal.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Building-canals-1.png|frame|none|Building a canal.]]

Once the canal is built, it's time to connect it to a lower level of water using locks.

If you need to build a dock - for example once the canal is close enough to the industry you're targeting - then just build a large (and expensive!) area for the ships to manoeuver and to build the dock, like in the next picture:

==Building locks==
# Open the ''Waterways construction'' toolbar by clicking the [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m2cc0c4cd.png]] button.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Dock toolbar.png|frame|none|The Waterways construction toolbar]]
# Click on the ''Build lock'' button [[File:en/Manual/Build locks.png]].
# Now find a suitable location for the lock. A lock requires two full flat tiles connected by a single slope.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Building-canals-2.png|frame|none|Suitable lock location.]]
# Click on the slope to build the lock.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Building-canals-3.png|frame|none|The lock.]]
# Repeat steps 3 and 4 to place more locks if necessary.

==Aqueducts==
''Aqueducts'' are bridges for boats. 

# Open the ''Waterways construction'' toolbar by clicking the [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m2cc0c4cd.png]] button.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Dock toolbar.png|frame|none|The Waterways construction toolbar.]]
# Click on the ''Build aqueduct'' button [[File:en/Manual/Build aqueduct.png]].
# Place your mouse where you want to start the aqueduct. White squares show where the aqueduct will be built. Unlike with bridges for trains or road vehicles, you do not need to click and drag to the other endpoint.[[File:en/Manual/AqueductConstruction.png|frame|none|Aqueduct construction.]]
# Left click to build the aqueduct.[[File:en/Manual/AqueductCompleted.png|frame|none|A completed aqueduct.]]
