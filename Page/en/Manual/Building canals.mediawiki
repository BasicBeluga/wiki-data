Sometimes you want a ship to go where there's no water. Maybe an [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Oil Refinery]] is located too far inland for a dock to accept oil, or some mountains are forcing your ships to make large detours.

Either way, a canal is what you need. Canals allow you to place water at any flat tile of land on the map, even if that tile is located above sea level.

A lock is used to allow ships to "climb hills": a lock connects two bodies of water at different height levels. Please note that canals and locks are very expensive. Make sure to have enough money before building a canal.

==Building canals==
# Open the ''Waterways construction'' toolbar by clicking the [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m2cc0c4cd.png]] button.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Dock toolbar.png|frame|none|The Waterways construction toolbar]]
# Click on the ''Build canal'' button [[File:en/Manual/Build canal.png]]. Remember, you can right click on any button if you ever want a description of what it does.
# Place the cursor on any flat tile of land and then left-click to place the canal tile. You can also click and drag to place longer stretches of canal.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Building-canals-1.png|frame|none|Building a canal.]]

Once the canal is built, it's time to connect it to a lower level of water using locks.

If you need to build a dock - for example once the canal is close enough to the industry you're targeting - then just build a large (and expensive!) area for the ships to manoeuver and to build the dock, like in the next picture:

==Building locks==
# Open the ''Waterways construction'' toolbar by clicking the [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m2cc0c4cd.png]] button.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Dock toolbar.png|frame|none|The Waterways construction toolbar]]
# Click on the ''Build lock'' button [[File:en/Manual/Build locks.png]].
# Now find a suitable location for the lock. A lock requires two full flat tiles connected by a single slope.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Building-canals-2.png|frame|none|Suitable lock location.]]
# Click on the slope to build the lock.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Building-canals-3.png|frame|none|The lock.]]
# Repeat steps 3 and 4 to place more locks if necessary.

==Aqueducts==
''Aqueducts'' are "bridges for boats". How to build bridges and aqueducts is covered in [[en/Manual/Building bridges]].
