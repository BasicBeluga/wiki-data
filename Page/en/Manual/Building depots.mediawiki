Here you will learn how to '''build''' (place, position) the '''depots''' so they align with your tracks.
Depots are places where you build your trains and also they are used by the running trains for servicing, so make sure trains can enter and exit from depots.

== How do I place a depot? ==

1. First of all, you must open the Railway construction toolbar - click the railway build button ( [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] ) on the [[en/Manual/Game interface#the-menu-bar|menu bar]] to display the railway construction toolbar:

2. Click on '''new depot button'''. A new window with depot direction selection will open.

3. '''Select the direction''' you want your depot to face - this is where the trains will exit to tracks.

4. Now you must '''position the depot next to your tracks''', facing the depot exit towards the tracks.

5. Once you are happy with the position, click your mouse to '''place the depot'''.

If there are rails adjustant to the depot, additional tracks will be placed automatically.

Remember, you can always '''destroy''' your depot with the '''dynamite tool''' ( [[File:en/Manual/Clear title.png]] ).

== Where do I place a depot? ==

Where to place a depot is a strategic decision completely up to you. (You can always just stick couple of depots on your lines and hope for the best :) )

You should make sure that trains:
* Can '''service effectively''';
* Will '''not cause traffic jams''' by servicing.


For example, you can position the depot at the end of a station:

Or you can put a depot at the entrance of the station:

Or you might decide to create drive-through servicing depots right on the main tracks:
