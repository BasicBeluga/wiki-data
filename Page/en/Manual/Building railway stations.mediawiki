In this tutorial you can learn how to '''build train''' (railway) '''stations''', how to '''connect railways''' to stations in efficient ways. Building stations efficiently is very important if you wish to establish a great train empire. There are hundreds of ways you can build stations, some examples below should direct you on the right path.
__TOC__
===Building train stations===
#Open the ''Railway Construction'' toolbar by clicking the [[File:en/Manual/RailCnstr.png]] button.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Railroad Construction.png|none|frame|Railway Construction toolbar.]]
#Click on the ''Build railroad station'' button [[File:en/Manual/RailSt.png]]. A station building window will appear. Remember, you can right click(*) on any button if you ever want a description of what it does.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Stationgui.png|none|frame|Train station selection window.]]
#Set the ''Number of Tracks'' and the ''Platform Length''. Remember that each "unit" will take two carriages, so you choose the length of your station according to the length of the trains you want to load there, i.e. a station of 3 squares long will take one locomotive and five carriages. Longer trains can stop there also, but loading/unloading will be slower.
#Select the orientation for your station so that you can run the track in the right direction.
#Find a place for the new station on the map. Besides building on flat land you can also [[en/Build on  slopes]]. It's possible to build over existing straight rail.
#Click the mouse to build the station.


(*) This has been replaced by "hover over" behaviour, you can still right click if the "hover over delay" is set to 0.


== What kinds of stations should I build? ==
That is completely up to you. The general guidelines would be:
* Trains should '''not cause traffic jams''' while entering and exiting the station
* Stations should be '''long enough''' for trains to fit completely (else loading times will be long)

Below are some examples of stations. Each example comes is presented in two different signal styles. One style uses [[en/Manual/Signals]] (stations in screenshots in red); this is the preferred method of signalling. The other style uses [[en/Manual/Signals]] and is kept here for legacy reasons. Read the article on [[en/Manual/Signals]] if you want to know more about the different types of signals. How to build signals is covered in [[en/Manual/Building signals]]. 

Important to remember when using path signals is that your longest train needs to be able to wait at all signals without blocking junctions. For that reason, some of the path signalled screenshots actually show more of the signal setup than the actual station itself.

=== Single stations ===
*'''Single terminus stations''' ''can service 1 train at a time''. Such stations serve very well when there isn't much cargo to transport.

*'''Single "Ro-Ro" station''' ("Roll-On Roll-Off") (The name used is a simile. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll-on/roll-off See Wikipedia]). The advantage of this station is that incoming trains don't have to wait for outgoing trains to leave. While this benefit is very small in case of single stations, the Ro-Ro setup becomes fare more effective with multi-platform stations (see below).

:It is a good practice to make the loading-exit and unloading-entrance lines to go straight into the station, while the loading-entrance and unloading-exit lines can loop around. This way trains delivering cargo will deliver it faster as well as loaded trains can leave faster.

:As you may have noticed, there are no path signals used in the example with path signals. This is due to the fact that this station is essentially incorporated into a single one-way track. Like with any other one-way track it is not necessary to use path signals in this case. Using path signals here makes absolutely no difference in station performance.

=== Double stations ===
''Once more cargo is served in stations,'' '''double stations''' '' with two platforms are preferred''. This could be the most used station type you build. Two platforms mean two trains. Once one train is done loading, the other can start loading immediately - it doesn't have to wait for previous one to exit station.

* The '''double terminus station''' has the advantage of an extra platform, but the disadvantage that trains need to cross at the junction either when entering or leaving the station. However, it is cheaper and consumes less space than a double Ro-Ro station.

<div style="float:right;width:50%;">[[File:en/Manual/RailStTut Two str pow.png|left|frame|Double terminus unloading station with block signals]]</div>


*You can also consider building a '''double Ro-Ro station''' to completely avoid any traffic jams and wait times. This station design will perform considerably better than the double terminus station in case you have more than three trains using the station.

=== Multi-track stations ===
Once the stations start servicing many trains, '''multi-track stations''' are preferred, so there are no long wait times for trains. If more than one train is waiting to enter a station, it has too little platforms. Adding more platforms is an easy solution. Below a four-track terminus and Ro-Ro station are shown. Bigger stations are just as easy: add even more platforms, make sure trains can enter and exit each platform and add the proper signalling.

*Below you can see a '''four track terminus station'''. Just keep in mind, that trains might have to wait a little to let other trains pass. Good alternative for the Ro-Ro if you're tight on space.

*And this would be a '''four track Ro-Ro station'''. Incoming trains do not have to wait for trains leaving this station.
