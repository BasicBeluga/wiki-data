__TOC__

==How do I lay roads?==

Click the ''Road construction'' button [[File:en/Manual/Roadcnstr.png]] in the [[en/Manual/Game interface#the-menu-bar|menu bar]] to open the ''Road construction'' toolbar:
[[File:en/Manual/Road constructionnew.png|none|frame|The road construction toolbar]]

There are two ways to lay roads:
* Using 2 directional road section buttons.
* Using the Autoroad tool.

== Building directional sections ==

Click on one of the directional road building buttons [[File:en/Manual/Build road.png]]. This example uses the 1st button.

=== Placing roads ===
#Move the cursor over the tile you want to start your road on.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Build roads01.png|none|frame|Laying a new road]]
#Drag the cursor to where you want your road to end.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Build roads02.png|none|frame|Laying a new road]]
#Release the mouse button and your new road will appear.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Build roads03.png|none|frame|Your new road]]

* Note that this works with half-tile precision. If you e.g. click in the right half of a tile and then drag to the right, the road will only cover half of the first tile. The same also applies to the end tile.

=== Removing roads === 
To remove the roads, '''select the Remove tool''' [[File:en/Manual/Toggle clear active.png|Clear button]]. The white square changes to a red square. '''Click & drag''' along the existing road sections to remove them. Click the Remove tool button again to deselect it. You can also use the '''R''' keyboard shortcut.

== Using Autoroad tool ==
'''Click the Autoroad''' button [[File:en/Manual/Autoroad.png|Autoroad button]] in the road construction toolbar. You cursor will change accordingly.

=== Placing roads ===
#You can place roads across the straight edges of tiles. Place your cursor over a square and '''click & drag''' along the squares.<br/>Move your mouse in different directions to see how roads would be placed.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/AutoroadTut2.png|none|frame|Laying a straight piece of tracks]]
#Release your the mouse button to buid a straight road as indicated by the outline.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/AutoroadTut3.png|none|frame|A newly built straight section of roads]]
#You cannot place diagonal roads.
#The autoroad tool works with hilly terrain too.

=== Removing roads ===
There are two ways to remove road sections (besides the dynamite [[File:en/Manual/Clear title.png|Dynamite tool]] tool).

*The easy way to remove roads is to hold down the CTRL key.

#To '''remove a section''' of roads, '''hold CTRL''' and '''click & drag''' along existing road section, just as you would when building roads.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/AutoroadTut7.png|none|frame|Deleting roads (with CTRL)]]
#Release the mouse button and the roads will be removed. Unlike with rail tracks, you lose money when removing roads.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/AutoroadTut8.png|none|frame|A newly deleted roads]]

*The second way is to '''select the Remove tool''' ( [[File:en/Manual/Toggle clear active.png|Clear button]] ). The white squares change to red squares. '''Click & drag''' along existing roads to remove them. Click the Remove tool button again to deselect it. You can also use the '''R''' keyboard shortcut.
