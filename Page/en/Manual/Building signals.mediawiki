'''Signals''' (normal signals and pre-signals) are all designed for one purpose - effectively '''directing your trains''', '''stopping them from crashing''' and taking correct routes and railways.

<!-- for wiki search bot mainly -->
This tutorial shows you how to build (place, change), re-design (change type of) and remove (delete) your signals. Demonstrates what signal types there are and how they are used. Pre-signals (entrance/entry, exit and combo) are described in detail with examples.

__TOC__

== How do I build signals? ==

First of all, you must open the Railway construction toolbar - click the railway build button ( [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] ) on the [[en/Manual/Game interface#the-menu-bar|menu bar]] to display the railway construction toolbar:
[[File:en/Manual/Railroad Construction.png|none|frame|The railway construction toolbar]]

Whatever signals you are building, you '''start of by placing normal signals'''. So read the 'How do I build normal signals' first if you are unfamiliar with the whole signal concept.

=== How do I build normal signals? ===

1. First, '''select the Place Signals''' ( [[File:en/Manual/Place signal.png]] ) button from the construction menu:
[[File:en/SignalTutorial1.png|none|frame|Selecting Place Signal button]]

2. Next, '''position your cursor over the railway tracks''', where you wish to build your signal.

[[File:en/Manual/Two-way signal.png|frame|right]]
3. '''Click once''' to place a signal on that piece of tracks. You will build a '''two-way signal''' - green or red lights will be shown to trains coming both ways.
[[File:en/Manual/SignalTutorial3.png|none|frame|]]

[[File:en/Manual/One-way signal.png|frame|right]]
4. '''Click again''' to re-design the newly built signal to a '''one-way signal'''. Now only the trains coming from the signal light side will be able to pass it. (Trains that are lost and coming from the other way will have to turn around).
[[File:en/Manual/SignalTutorial4.png|none|frame|]]

5. '''Click again''' to re-design the signal again to '''face the other way''' than before.
[[File:en/Manual/SignalTutorial5.png|none|frame|]]

6. '''Click again''' and you will revert '''back to''' your '''two-way signal'''.


=== How do I build pre-signals? ===

Building pre-signals is very much alike re-designing signals with the exception that you must '''hold the CTRL button down'''. Once you know how to build pre-signals, you can read below to understand the way they work.

[[File:en/Manual/Entry presignal.png|frame|right]]
1. '''Position''' you cursor '''over an already built signal''' (does not matter whether it is one-way or two-way signal). '''Hold down CTRL''' and '''click''' to re-design your signal to a '''Entrance pre-signal'''.
[[File:en/SignalTutorial6.png|none|frame|]]

[[File:en/Manual/Exit presignal.png|frame|right]]
2. '''Hold CTRL and click''' again to re-design the signal to an '''Exit pre-signal'''.
[[File:en/SignalTutorial7.png|none|frame|]]

[[File:en/Manual/Combo presignal.png|frame|right]]
3. '''Hold CTRL and click''' the signal one more time to change the signal to the last pre-signal type - '''Combo pre-signal'''.
[[File:en/SignalTutorial8.png|none|frame|]]

'''Note:''' You can always change your pre-signals to one-way pre-signals by clicking them with Place Signals tool without holding down CTRL.

'''Note:''' It does not matter if you build one-way signals first and then change them to pre-signals OR build pre-signals first and then change them to on-way.

== How do I remove signals? ==

To remove signals, '''select the Remove tool''' ( [[File:en/Manual/Toggle clear active.png|Clear button]] ). The white square will change to a red square. Now you can simply '''click''' the signals to remove them. Click the tool button again to deselect it. You can also use the '''R''' key shortcut.

1. '''Position''' your cursor '''over the signal with the Clear button''' ( [[File:en/Manual/Toggle clear active.png|Clear button]] ).
[[File:en/SignalTutorial9.png|none|frame|]]

2. '''Click''' the signal '''to remove''' it.
[[File:en/SignalTutorial10.png|none|frame|]]

== What do these signals do? ==

=== Normal signals ===

Basic idea - '''doesn't let your trains pass if there is something behind the signal blocking their path'''.

''The author is lazy, so see [[en/Manual/Signals]] (which doesn't have much info).''

''Hopefully, I will update this soon. ;)''

=== Pre-signals ===

'''The pre-signals don't let your trains go forward if there is nowhere to go right now''' - all the signals afterwards are red lights. You can proceed on reading the full description of signals, however, '''see the example below to understand what the benefits of using the pre-signals are'''.

==== A valuable example ====

For example, you might have a Ro-Ro station (1 side - entrance; other side - exit).
[[File:en/SignalTutorial11.png|none|frame|]]

This is how you would place the normal signals for this station.
[[File:en/SignalTutorial12.png|none|frame|]]

If two trains arrive at the station, both station platforms will be unaccessible and both station platform entry signals will be showing red lights. This however does not prevent the first signal to show green, since there are no obstacles on the tracks between the first signal and second signal line.
[[File:en/SignalTutorial13.png|none|frame|]]

So what happens when the next train arrives? It simply passes the first green light and then has to choose a path which will be blocked anyway. It might work fine for some cases, but what if the train on the other platform leaves first? The new train will still have to wait.
[[File:en/SignalTutorial14.png|none|frame|]]

Here come the pre-signals. Once correctly positioned, the first signal light will also stay red as long as all the other signal lights are red and the new train has nowhere to go.
[[File:en/SignalTutorial15.png|none|frame|]]

This way, when a track clears, the new train can proceed to that track.
[[File:en/SignalTutorial16.png|none|frame|]]

==== The pre-signal types ====

As seen in 'How do I build pre-signals?', you can build 3 types of pre-signals. These are two major types and a combination of the two.

| [[File:en/Manual/Entry presignal.png]]
| '''Entry''' pre-signal
| '''Only shows green if at least one of the following Exit pre-signals shows green.''' This signal won't let your trains pass if they will be unable to choose a route afterwards - e.g., all station lines occupied, all bridges or tunnels taken, all connecting lines busy, etc. Make sure you place Exit pre-signals for every needed exit route of the trains. If you don't place Exit pre-signals, Entry pre-signal will act like a normal signal.

|-
| [[File:en/Manual/Exit presignal.png]]
| '''Exit''' pre-signal
| '''Positioned after the Entry pre-signal to control its state.''' You place these signals on all exit routes of a train, so that Entry-signal knows to check these signals for their lights. It makes sense to have more than 1 Exit pre-signal for every Entry pre-signal.

|-
| [[File:en/Manual/Combo presignal.png]]
| '''Combo''' pre-signal
| '''Acts as a both Entry and Exit pre-signal.''' If you are splitting busy lines, you might want to use this signal that would act as both Exit pre-signal (for some Entry-signal) as well as Entry-signal (for a group of some Exit-signals), e.g. a trainway splitting into 2 routes and then each route splitting into 3 routes, a total of 6 routes, for, let's say, a coal unloading station for many trains.

|[[File:en/SignalTutorial17.png]]
|Here you can see a 6-line station entrance. The first signal the trains is the Entry pre-signal, after which each station platform entrance has Exit an pre-signal. This way no traffic jams will occur because train doesn't have a route to go and goes the wrong way, causing blockage.

|-
|[[File:en/SignalTutorial18.png]]
|This is a more advanced 6-line station entrance. First the trains choose from two inital entry routes and then from 3 remaining. 
* The first Entry pre-signal is green only if any of the Combo pre-signals are green (acting as Exit pre-signals here). In other words - if at least one station platform is free.
* The second Entry-Exit (Combo) pre-signals are green only if there is a free platform after them (now acting as Entry pre-signals).
* Finally each plaform has an Exit pre-signal.

|-
|[[File:en/SignalTutorial19.png]]
|This is a simple two-line station with the entrance being also the exit. Pre-signals play a very important role for this station, as it could get a serious traffic jam (no trains can leave and none can enter) if more than 2 trains start servicing at the same time. When trains are entering Entry pre-signal looks for green lights at the station line Exit signals. When exiting trains have 1 exit route so they don't need additional signals and Exit pre-signals act as normal signals for them.
''(Exit pre-signals could be replaced with Combo pre-signals and Normal signal with Exit pre-signal, but the incoming trains would turn around and leave if the platforms were full. Perhaps in future, if 90 degrees turns are disabled for trains, this will work as well.)''
