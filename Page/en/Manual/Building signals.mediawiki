__TOC__

== Constructing a signal ==

1. Click the '''Build railway track''' [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] button on the [[en/Manual/Game interface#the-menu-bar|menu bar]] to display the Railway Construction toolbar:
[[File:en/Manual/Railroad Construction.png|none|frame|The Railway Construction toolbar]]

2. Click the '''Build railway signals''' [[File:en/Manual/Place signal.png]] button from the Railway Construction toolbar to display the Signal Selection toolbar:
[[File:en/Manual/Signal Selection.png|none|frame|The Signal Selection toolbar]]

This toolbar is fairly simple to navigate. The top row has semaphore signals, and the bottom row has light signals. Each signal type is functionally identical to the one above/below it, so choose the signal you wish to give the desired look you want for your railway.

From left to right on this toolbar, the signal types are block signal, entry signal, exit signal, combo signal, path signal, and one-way path signal. If at any time you are unsure as to which signal is which or you want to know more about each signal's purpose, you can '''hold right-click on the button''' in the Signal Selection toolbar and a tooltip will be displayed giving you more information.

3. Once you have selected a signal type, '''position your cursor over the railway tracks''', where you wish to build your signal.

4. '''Click once''' to construct a signal on the track. ''Unless you chose a path signal'', you will build a '''two-way signal'''. Path signals always face one direction only.

5. '''Click again''' to convert your signal to a '''one-way signal'''. Now, unless you have built a standard path signal, only trains coming from the direction the signal faces will be able to pass it. All signal direction alterations are free of charge.

6. '''Click again''' to convert the signal to face the opposite direction.

7. '''Click again''' to convert your signal back to a '''two-way signal'''.

== Constructing a line of signals ==

You can also build several signals of the same type at once by clicking and dragging along the section of track you want signals built on. However you may find it more useful to click and drag from an existing signal, as doing so will construct a line of signals facing the same direction:

1. While the '''Build railway signals''' [[File:en/Manual/Place signal.png]] tool is selected, '''position your cursor over an existing signal'''.

2. '''Click and drag''' the mouse along the railway track.

3. '''Release the mouse''' to place the signals.

Depending on the value displayed on the '''Dragging signal density''' [[File:en/Manual/Signal Density.png]] button on the Signal Selection toolbar, signals will be placed every N game tiles (the default value for N is 4) when constructing a line of signals this way. You may change the dragging signal density by clicking the small arrows on the button. Also note that if you click and drag from entry, exit or combo signals, this method will construct block signals facing the same direction.

== Converting signals to different types ==

You can convert an existing signal to a different signal type by clicking the '''Signal Convert''' [[File:en/Manual/Signal Convert.png]] button on the Signal Selection toolbar. Then, when you click on an existing signal it will be converted free of charge to the signal type selected in the Signal Selection toolbar. To turn signal conversion off (if you want to return to constructing signals), click the Signal Convert button again.

== Removing signals ==

You can remove existing signals by clicking the '''Bulldozer''' [[File:en/Manual/Toggle clear active.png|Clear button]] button on the Railway Construction toolbar, while having the Signal Selection toolbar open. The white square will change to a red square. Then you may click on individual signals to remove them or click and drag along a section of track to remove a line of signals. Click the tool button again to deselect it. You can also use the '''R''' key shortcut.

This tool obeys the value displayed on the '''Dragging signal density'''[[File:en/Manual/Signal Density.png]] button on the Signal Selection toolbar.
