=== Purchasing Aircraft ===

There are many different types of aircraft available for purchase in OpenTTD. Some of them have very functional roles to play in your transport route, others may not be economically feasible in your route system.  The aircraft you choose will depend on the number of passengers, or other cargo your aircraft is going to be carrying.


Building airplanes is just as easy as building trains.  Trains require a depot to be constructed, where as aircraft require you to select on the hangar located on an airport to be constructed.

=== Aircraft Scheduling ===

In order for an aircraft to do anything useful, you will need to assign a schedule to the aircraft.  This is done the same way you would assign a route to a Bus/Ship/Train.
