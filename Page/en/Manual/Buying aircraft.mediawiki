Managing an airline is different then managing an airport in that once an airport is constructed, your commitment to it is by and large over.  An airline on the other hand is dynamic, always changing, and can be at times a little trying.  Just as you would maintain oversight over any of your other networks, working with the aircraft can be a rewarding and lucrative experience.

== Purchasing Aircraft ==

There are many different types of aircraft available for purchase in OpenTTD. Some of them have very functional roles to play in your transport route, others may not be economically feasible in your route system.  The aircraft you choose will depend on the number of passengers, or other cargo your aircraft is going to be carrying.


Building airplanes is just as easy as building trains.  Trains require a depot to be constructed, where as aircraft require you to select on the hangar located on an airport to be constructed.

'''Step One''': Click the mouse where the mouse cursor is on this image to bring up the Aircraft Hangar Window.

'''Step Two''': Click on the new Aircraft button located on the lower left-side of the Aircraft Hangar Window. This will bring up the New Aircraft Window.

'''Step Three''': Review the list of available aircraft.  In the beginning of a game there is not a very large selection of aircraft to choose from, but never the less it is an important choice.

'''Step Four''': After clicking the Build Aircraft button a window will appear showing the aircraft in the Hangar.

'''Step Five''': If you want to carry something else than passengers and mail, you need to refit the aircraft.  While it is standing in the hangar, press the "refit" button in the Aircraft Window.

== Aircraft Scheduling ==

In order for an aircraft to do anything useful, you will need to assign a schedule to the aircraft.  This is done the same way you would assign a route to a Bus/Ship/Train.

== Managing Your Route Structure ==

Setting up your initial schedule is only the beginning of generating a profitable airline.  A route from one airport to another even with the best airport placement does not mean you will operate efficiently.  


Like any station an airport generates passengers from the surrounding community - those buildings which are inside the catchment area of the airport.  To find out which type of aircraft would best serve an airport, you should know the following items:

*Maximum passengers per month in both cities
*Distance/Time between the two airports
*Traffic load at a current airport


Using the information above allows you to make an educated guess as to the type of aircraft that would be the most economical between these two airports.  Below are some case studies that explore what type of aircraft would be more economical between two cities or group of cites.
