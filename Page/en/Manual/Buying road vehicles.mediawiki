==How do I sell / delete road vehicles?==
There are a few ways to sell a road vehicle. You can sell one vehicle at a time, or sell all vehicles in a depot. Either way, vehicles you want to sell need to be inside a depot, so you need to send the vehicle to the depot first.

# Click on a road vehicle to open its ''Road Vehicle window''.
# Click the ''Send vehicle to depot'' button on the right of the window.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Buying-road-vehicles-6.png|none|frame|Click on the Send vehicle to depot button to send the vehicle to the nearest depot.]]
# Wait until the road vehicle has arrived at the depot.
# Once the vehicle reaches the depot, click on the depot to open the ''Road Vehicle Depot'' window. Locate the vehicle in this window.
#There are two ways to sell vehicles:
#* Drag the vehicle in the depot to the sell vehicle icon:<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Buying-road-vehicles-7.png|none|frame|Drag a road vehicle to the first of the three buttons at the right to sell it.]]
#* Click on the ''Sell all vehicles'' button. This sells all vehicles inside the depot.<br/>[[File:en/Manual/Buying-road-vehicles-8.png|none|frame|Click on the second button to sell all road vehicles inside the depot. You will be asked to confirm you want to sell all the vehicles in the depot.]]
