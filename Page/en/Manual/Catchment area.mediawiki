The <b>Catchment Area</b> of a station is the radius around the stage that it can service. Town-buildings and industries that are within a station's catchment area accept cargo and passengers through this station, and will place their cargo at the station to be delivered elsewhere.

When a building is covered by multiple catchment areas, the station with the highest rating will get the largest part of the passengers or cargo.

Notice that when three or more catchment areas cover the same building, only the two catchment areas with the higher rating will get passengers/cargo.
