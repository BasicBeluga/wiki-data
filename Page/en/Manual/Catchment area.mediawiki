[[Translation:en/Manual/Catchment area]]
The <b>Catchment Area</b> of a station is the radius around the stage that it can service. Town-buildings and industries that are within a station's catchment area accept cargo and passengers through this station, and will place their cargo at the station to be delivered elsewhere.

When a building is covered by multiple catchment areas, the station with the highest rating will get the largest part of the passengers or cargo.
