[[Translation:en/Manual/Catchment area]]


[[File:en/Manual/Catchmentarea.png|thumb|right|250px|In the screenshot, the blue zone is the station's catchment area.]]
The '''Catchment Area''' of a [[en/Manual/Stations]] is the radius around the stage that it can service. [[en/Manual/Towns|Town-buildings]] and [[en/Manual/Industries]] that are within a station's catchment area accept [[en/Manual/Cargo]] through this station, and will place their cargo at the station to be delivered elsewhere.

== Setting: Allow more realistically sized catchment areas ==
If the ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Stations#allow-more-realistically-sized-catchment-areas|Allow more realistically sized catchment areas]]'' option is  on then the size of the catchment area depends on the type of the station. Otherwise it has a radius of 4 tiles for every station.

For a single physical station, [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Modified catchment]] is the same as catchment area. This attribute of a station is inherent. If the ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Stations#|Allow more realistically sized catchment areas]]'' option is ON then the station radius of a single physical station depends on the type of the station.

: ''For a combined station, the radius of each of its component physical stations is '''promoted''' to the radius of the most extensive component.''

So, the lone road station shown, '''Altoona''', has a radius of 3. The lone rail station, '''Altoona West''', has a radius of 4. But if we demolish Altoona West and rebuild it as a rail station combined with Altoona, then the road station's radius is ''promoted'' to 4 as well. 


== Cargo Acceptance of stations ==
Every industry square can provide the cargo produced by that industry. Having multiple catchment area squares overlapping an industry doesn't give any advantages. However, coverage for town-building has direct effect on [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Passengers]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Mail]] received. So the strategy to boost the [[en/Manual/Towns#town-growth|town growth]] and building non-physically attached stations to increase the catchment area will improve the patronage of large station which is difficult to be built near the center of the town.

== Cargo Delivery from industries to stations ==
In some industries only certain squares can accept the cargo required by that industry. You can use the [[en/Manual/Land area information]] tool to find out which square accept cargo. When building a station you can see, in the station building dialog, which types of cargo will be accepted by the industries in the catchment area. For [[en/Manual/Stations#building-non-physically-attached-stations|non-physically attached combined stations]] the catchment area also covers all the space between the individual stations. Both stations in the picture wouldn't accept oil if they were built as separate stations because they are too far away from the refinery. But since they form a single combined station their catchment area extends over the refinery and makes them accept oil. This only applies for delivery, not for pickup of cargo. Thus the pictured stations won't get the goods produced by the refinery. (The described case and picture applies when the ''Allow more realistically sized catchment areas'' option is enabled.)

== Catchment Area and Station Rating ==
When a building is covered by multiple catchment areas, the station with the highest [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#station-rating|rating]] will get the largest part of the cargo. Note that when three or more catchment areas cover the same building, only the two catchment areas with the highest ratings will get cargo.
