OpenTTD has a variety of '''Cheats''' to make gameplay easier. Cheating is not, and never will be possible in multiplayer games the way it is mentioned in this article, but see below for more information on multiplayer cheating.

To access the cheat menu press ''Ctrl + Alt + C''. This only works in single player games. If you have another program that responds to this shortcut running, please use ''Ctrl + Alt + [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/windows_key Windows] + C''. If your keyboard does not include the Windows keys, you'll need to use the Ctrl + Alt + C combination, and in order to do that you'll need to first change that other program's settings, or even close it - to prevent it from responding to the combination.

Most of the cheats are self-explanatory but a brief description is available anyway.

==Increase money by £10,000,000==
Increases (or decreases) available money by £10,000,000. You can press it as many times as you like.

==Playing as company #==
Allows you to become the AI player, control their vehicles, etc.

Save your game before using this cheat because an assertion error may occur and you'll lose all you have been working on.

==Magic bulldozer==
The [[en/Archive/Manual/Magic bulldozer]] allows you to destroy [[en/Manual/Industries]] and other normally unmoveable objects such as lighthouses.

Please be aware that with this option on, if a [[en/Manual/Towns]] grows towards an industry it will eventually delete this industry.

==Tunnels may cross each other==
Allows you to build [[en/Archive/Manual/Crossing tunnels|tunnels that intersect]] underground.

==Build while in pause mode==
Allows you to build whilst the game is [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build in pause|paused]]. This was previously a patch but it was changed to a cheat because it gives an unfair advantage over AI players.

==Jetplanes will not crash (frequently) on small airports==
Large airplanes don't have a tendency to crash all the time on small airports. They will crash occasionally though, with the same frequency as crashes at other airports.

==Enable modifying production values==
Allows you to modify the amount of cargo produced by industries.

==Switch climate==
You can switch a running game between the four [[en/Manual/Climates]]. This might be useful to obtain vehicles from other climates or just for fun. Note that this might have a few unwanted effects on vehicles, industries and cargo types.

==Change date==
The time is at your hand! You can go back in time or travel to the future in one-year-steps with this cheat. Unfortunately, it doesn't affect inflation or expired vehicles. Also, travelling before the year in which you began your game prevents the financial infomation from working properly.

==Allow Electric Trains to run on normal track==
{{en/Note|This is not a cheat in 0.7.0, but an Advanced Setting available from the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings]] menu, which disables electric rails altogether.}}
Allows electric trains to run on normal track, for those that dislike e-rails.

==Cheating in network games==
The cheats listed on above are not available in multiplayer games.  The only way to enable them is to modify the source code and recompile the game running on the server, something which is heavily frowned upon.  If you must do this you should at least inform the clients that they are playing on a server with cheating enabled.

There are, however, other ways to "cheat" in a multiplayer game.  See [[en/Community/Multiplayer cheating]] for more information on this and how to avoid it.
==Cheat Effects==
If you use or used a cheat in a specific game session, your score will not be included in the High Scores list, in that session, sill cheating can be good for debugging/sandboxing purposes. (It's easy to gain money in this game, even with harder NewGRF's but sometimes you just want to test something out.

Magical bulldozer has some side effects though. As not only you as player gain higher bulldozer rights, also the towns get the ability to remove industries.
==Easier Cheat==
When playing against an AI, place railroad track (any track) over all there roads and demolish the track, which should destroy the road and track. After you have done this build something like a [[en/Manual/Depots]] around the AI's town, which means they can't build road through ''YOUR'' depots so they can't send buses or lorries anyware.
