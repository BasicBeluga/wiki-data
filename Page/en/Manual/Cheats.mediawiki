OpenTTD has a variety of '''Cheats''' to make its gameplay into more of a sandbox mode. Cheating is not, and never will be possible in multiplayer games the way it is mentioned in this article, but see [[en/Manual/Cheats]] for more information on multiplayer cheating and staying safe.


To access the cheat menu press Ctrl + Alt + C. It only works in single player games. (If you have another program that responds to this shortcut running, please use Ctrl + Alt + [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/windows_key Windows] + C. If your keyboard does not include the Windows keys, you'll need to use the Ctrl + Alt + C combination, and in order to do that you'll need to first change that other program's settings, or even close it - to prevent it from responding to the combination.)


Most of the cheats are self-explanatory but a brief description is available anyway.

===Increase money by £10,000,000===
Increases available money by £10,000,000. You can press it as many times as you like.

SHITTY BULLOCKS

===Playing as player #===
Allows you to become the AI player, control their vehicles, etc.

Save your game before using this cheat otherwise an assertion error may occur and you'll lose all you have been working on

===Magic Bulldozer===
Allows you to destroy industries and other normally unmoveable objects such as lighthouses.

Please be aware of, when leaving this option turned on, when a city grows towards a industry, it will eventually delete this industry!

===Tunnels may cross each other===
Allows you to build [[en/Archive/Manual/Crossing tunnels|tunnels that intersect]] underground.

===Build while in pause mode===
Allows you to build whilst the game is paused. This was previously a patch but it was changed to a cheat because it is unfair on the AI.

===Airplanes will not crash (frequently) on small airports===
Airplanes don't have a tendency to crash all the time on small airports. They will crash occasionally though, with the same frequency as crashes at other airports.

===Enable modifying production values===
Allows you to modify the amount of cargo produced by industries.

===Switch climate===
You can switch a running game between the [[en/Manual/Climates]] "temperate", "sub-arctic", "sub-tropical" and "toyland". This might be useful to obtain vehicles from other climates or just for fun. Note that this might have a few unwanted effects on vehicles, industries and cargo types.

===Change date===
The time is at your hand! You can go back in time or travel to the future in one-year-steps with this cheat.. Unfortunately, it doesn't affect inflation or expired vehicles. Also, travelling before the year in which you began your game prevents the financial infomation from working properly.

===Allow Electric Trains to run on normal track===
Allows electric trains to run on normal track, for those that dislike e-rails. (nightlies/post 0.4.8 only)
