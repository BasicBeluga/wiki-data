you should figrue out what you want to do before you get your degree, because if you have a general idea you can make sure that you get the necessary qualifications.  for example if after graduation you wanted to be a social worker, having you LPC of LMSW is needed, a Health science degree will not get you the job, it's awesome to have and you can have many opportunities but its best to try and plan ahead, good luck  Was this answer helpful?
