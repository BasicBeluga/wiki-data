Most of the cheats are self-explanatory but a brief description is available anyway.


====Increase money by $20,000,000====
Increases available money by $20,000,000. You can press it as many times as you like.


====Playing as player #====
Allows you to become the AI player, control their vehicles, etc.


====Magic Bulldozer====
Allows you to destroy industries and other normally unmoveable objects such as lighthouses.


====Tunnels may cross each other====
Allows you to build tunnels that cross each other.


====Build while in pause mode====
Allows you to build whilst the game is paused. This was previously a patch but it was changed to a cheat because it is unfair on the AI.


====Airplanes will not crash (frequently) on small airports====
Airplanes don't have a tendency to crash all the time on small airports. They will crash occasionally though, with the same frequency as crashes at other airports.

===Switch climate===
You can switch a running game between the [[en/Manual/Climates]] "temperate", "sub-arctic", "sub-tropical" and "toyland". This might be useful to obtain vehicles from other climates or just for fun. Note that this might have a few unwanted effects on vehicles, industries and cargo types.
