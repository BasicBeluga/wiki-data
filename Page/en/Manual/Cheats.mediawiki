Warning! You are about to betray your fellow competitors. Keep in mind that such a disgrace will be remembered for eternity.

(If you have Trillian running, please use Ctrl-Alt-Windows-C.)


Most of the cheats are self-explanatory but a brief description is available anyway.


[[File:en/Example.mp3]]<nowiki>Insert non-formatted text here</nowiki>===Increase money by $20,000,000===
Increases available money by $20,000,000. You can press it as many times as you like.

===Playing as player #===
Allows you to become the AI player, control their vehicles, etc.


===Magic Bulldozer===
Allows you to destroy industries and other normally unmoveable objects such as lighthouses.


===Tunnels may cross each other===
Allows you to build tunnels that [[en/Archive/Manual/Crossing tunnels|cross each other]].

===Build while in pause mode===
Allows you to build whilst the game is paused. This was previously a patch but it was changed to a cheat because it is unfair on the AI.

===Airplanes will not crash (frequently) on small airports===
Airplanes don't have a tendency to crash all the time on small airports. They will crash occasionally though, with the same frequency as crashes at other airports.


===Switch climate===
You can switch a running game between the [[en/Manual/Climates]] "temperate", "sub-arctic", "sub-tropical" and "toyland". This might be useful to obtain vehicles from other climates or just for fun. Note that this might have a few unwanted effects on vehicles, industries and cargo types.

===Change date===
The time is at your hand! You can go back in time or travel to the future in one-year-steps with this cheat.. Unfortunately, it doesn't affect inflation or expired vehicles. Also, travelling before the year in which you began your game prevents the financial infomation from working properly.
