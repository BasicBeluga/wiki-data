There are 4 climates, Temperate, Desert, Arctic and Toyland &mdash; each with its own [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Landscape]]. Apart from a different set of graphics for the buildings and scenery, each one has a different set of [[en/Manual/Trains]]s, [[en/Manual/Vehicles]]s and [[en/Manual/Industries|industries]] (although most vehicles are shared between climates, and Arctic and Tropical climates have an identical set of vehicles). The climate also affects characteristics of the game such as requirements for [[en/Manual/Towns]]s to grow, and growth-rate.

==Temperate==

The temperate climate dates back to the original Transport Tycoon of 1994. The Temperate Climate is based on the [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/United Kingdom None], where Chris Sawyer, Simon Foster and John Broomhall live. This is reflected in the vehicles, which are based on vehicles that are regularly seen in the UK. It is also evident in the architecture. Many buildings in the game are based on real life buildings found in Glasgow, Chris Sawyer's home.

The temperate climate is the most popular climate, as it features the highest variety of vehicles. This is also reflected in [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] sets that take vehicle is from other climates to work in temperate. Temperate also has one of the highest valued goods, coal. Coal is also found in Sub-arctic.

==Sub-arctic==
All land above a certain height is covered in snow. Any towns based above the snowline require a supply of food to grow.

==Tropical==
Land is divided into desert and jungle areas. Towns in desert area require food and water to grow. A town can only recieve water if it contains a water-tower.

==Toyland==
This surreal landscape has a kid's world theme to it. The vehicles are based on toys, and the industries are based on toys and sweets.
