There are 4 climates, Temperate, Desert, Arctic and Toyland &mdash; each with it's own [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Landscape]]. Apart from a different set of graphics for the buildings and scenery, each one has a different set of [[en/Manual/Trains]]s, [[en/Manual/Vehicles]]s and [[en/Manual/Industries|industries]] (although most vehicles are shared between climates, and Arctic and Tropical climates have an identical set of vehicles). The climate also affects characteristics of the game such as requirements for [[en/Manual/Towns]]s to grow, and growth-rate.

==Temperate==
This is the simplest climate to operate in. Towns just need a transportation service to grow. Also, faster and more powerful trains tend to be available earlier in the game.

==Arctic==
All land above a certain height is covered in snow. Any towns based above the snowline require a supply of food to grow.

==Tropical==
Land is divided into desert and jungle areas. Towns in desert area require food and water to grow. A town can only recieve water if it contains a water-tower.

==Toyland==
This surreal landscape has a kid's world theme to it. The vehicles are based on toys, and the industries are based on toys and sweets.
