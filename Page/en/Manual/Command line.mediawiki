Commandline is the 



== How do i use it? ==

In windows, there is the shortcut way and the DOS prompt way. 

'''The shortcut way:'''
Make a shortcut of the program you want to do commandline on, in this case openttd.exe, and right klick it and select properties. Then, you look in the first box. It should say something like this:
 ''C:/Games/Openttd.exe''.  



Now, put double or single quotes around the text. 
 ''"C:/Games/Openttd.exe"''  



Then put the parameters afterwards, outside the quotes. 
 ''"C:/Games/Openttd.exe" -m''  


If you want modifyers, insert them one space after the parameter:
 ''"C:/Games/Openttd.exe" -m 127.12.13.1'' 



If you want multiple parameters, separate them whit spaces
 ''"C:/Games/Openttd.exe" -m -s null 


Now, when you run the game using the shortcut (Remeber to klick OK, not cancel), things should happen.



'''The DOS way.'''
It is the same, only to acess it, start the ms dos prompt, go to the games adress, and do like above, only whitout the quotes. This requires basic DOS knowledge. If you don't have that, use the one above.
