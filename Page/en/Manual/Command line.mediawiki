== What is commandline? ==

Commandline is the 



== How do i use it? ==

In windows, there is the shortcut way and the DOS prompt way. 

'''The shortcut way:'''
Make a shortcut of the program you want to do commandline on, in this case openttd.exe, and right click it and select properties. Then, you look in the first box. It should say something like this:
 ''C:/Games/Openttd.exe''.  



Now, put double or single quotes around the text. 
 ''"C:/Games/Openttd.exe"''  



Then put the parameters afterwards, outside the quotes. 
 ''"C:/Games/Openttd.exe" -m''  


If you want modifyers, insert them one space after the parameter:
 ''"C:/Games/Openttd.exe" -m 127.12.13.1'' 



If you want multiple parameters, separate them with spaces
 ''"C:/Games/Openttd.exe" -m -s null 


Now, when you run the game using the shortcut (Remember to click OK, not Cancel), things should happen.



'''The DOS way.'''
It is the same, only to access it, start the MS-DOS prompt, go to the games adress, and do like above, only without the quotes. This requires basic DOS knowledge. If you don't have that, use the one above.

I hope you got it now. Enjoy :D

== Whitch are there? ==

Here's a list of the command line things that can be done:

{| border="1"
|+ Commandline options:
|-
! Code !! Params !! Description !! Example
|-
| -s || value || This parameter tell the game what to do whit the sound. I only know that you can tell it to do -s null to run the game whitout sound. || 
-s null
|-
| -v || value || This tells the game what to do whit the video. -v null wil run the game whit no video. The game wil crash then, so it's rather pointless. || -v null ||
|-
| -m || IP || This tells OpenTTD to start a multiplayer game. You use IP, ([http://www.whatismyip.com What is my ip?]) to connect to a server, where IP is replaced by the hosts IP (He must have started the game with -m first). If you want to test if it works and if you got it right, then you start a game with -m and a second game with -m 127.0.0.1, that will make you join you're own game (127.0.0.1 is localhost) || 
-m 10.10.101.10
|-
| -p || Player ID || With this, you can make coop games, sort of, where multiple players control the same company. Replace "Player ID" with the number of the player. Start counting from the top of the player list. Don't join an AI, it'll go nuts. || -p 2 ||
