The '''console''' allows you to see [[en/Manual/Multiplayer]] chat history and to execute [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS DOS]-style commands in OpenTDD. Most of the commands are used to configure multiplayer [[en/Manual/Server|servers]].


==Using the Console==
Open the console with the tilde key (~), located to the left of '1' on the main keyboard. On some international keyboards the symbol may differ.  There is also a "Toggle Console" option in the help menu. Type in your command, such as "help", and press Enter.  

Tips:
* Scroll the console with Shift+Up/Down or Shift+Pageup/Pagedown.
* Scroll through the input history with the Up/Down arrow keys
* Make the console bigger with Ctrl+Enter
* Paste text from the clipboard with the normal Ctrl+V (Windows only)
