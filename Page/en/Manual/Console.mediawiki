[[Translation:en/Manual/Console]]
The console allows you to enter a number of commands to get info about the current game, change various options, or end it/start a new one. It can be opened by pressing the key located to the left of digit '1' on the main keyboard.  On many keyboards this is the tilde (~), but on some international keyboards the symbol may differ.  These pages should help you to get all the information about the console you'll ever need.
