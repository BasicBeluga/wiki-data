[[Translation:en/Manual/Console]]
The '''console''' allows you to execute DOS-style commands in OpenTDD.  Most of the commands are used to configure [[en/Manual/Multiplayer]] servers.


==Using the Console==
Open the console with the tilde key (~), located to the left of '1' on the main keyboard. On some international keyboards the symbol may differ.  There is also a "Toggle Console" option in the help menu. Then type in a command, such as "help", and press Enter.  

Tips:
* To scroll the console, use Shift+Up/Down or Shift+Pageup/Pagedown.
* To scroll through the input history, use the Up/Down arrow keys
* To make the console bigger, press Ctrl+Enter
* Paste text from the clipboard with the normal Ctrl+V (Windows only)
