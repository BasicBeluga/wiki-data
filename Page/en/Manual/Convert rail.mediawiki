The '''convert rail''' button will activate a drag-and-drop tool that allows you to convert one type of rail to another (rail -> monorail -> maglev). This tool can be used on [[en/Manual/Building tracks|rail]], [[en/Manual/Building depots|depots]], [[en/Manual/Stations]] and [[en/Manual/Waypoints]].

Trains you already have running should be send to the depot and then destroyed [[en/Manual/Sell entire train|completely]].

Only empty depots can be converted.

===Nightly Build r4152 and after it===
With the introduction of electrified railways in r4152, the convert rail tool offers this fourth option allowing you to convert normal rails to electrified rails.

For this conversion, updating trains is not immediately necessary as steam and diesel trains run perfectly on electrified rails.  Electrified trains, however, will not pass over non-electrified tiles.
