==Convert rail==
To select which [[en/Manual/Base Set/Types of railway|type of railway]] to convert to, click and hold the railway build button in the main menu.

Depending on the option you selected, one of the following toolbars is displayed:
[[File:en/Manual/Railroad Construction.png|none|frame|[[en/Manual/Railway construction#railway-construction-toolbar|Railway construction toolbar]].]]
[[File:en/Manual/Electrified Railway Construction.png|none|frame|Electrified Railway construction toolbar.]]
[[File:en/Manual/Monorail Construction.png|none|frame|Monorail construction toolbar.]]
[[File:en/Manual/Maglev Construction.png|none|frame|Maglev construction toolbar.]]

Click the [[File:en/Manual/Convert rail.png]] '''convert rail''' button. This allows you to drag to select an area to convert from one type of rail to another (i.e. to rail, electrified rail, monorail or maglev). This tool can be used on [[en/Manual/Building tracks|tracks]], [[en/Manual/Building depots|depots]], [[en/Manual/Bridges|bridges]], [[en/Manual/Tunnels|tunnels]], [[en/Manual/Stations]] and [[en/Manual/Waypoints|waypoints]].

* To convert bridges and tunnels: select at least one end.

* To convert stations: convert all tile of a platform. You can mix different types or rail within a single station ([[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Nonuniform stations|Nonuniform stations]]).

* Unless you are converting from [[en/Manual/Base Set/Railways|normal railway]] to [[en/Manual/Base Set/Electrified railways|electrified railway]]), ensure that the line has no trains on it. Any trains you already have running should be sent to the first (and possibly [[en/Manual/Sell entire train|sold]]).

* You can convert from [[en/Manual/Base Set/Railways|normal railway]] to [[en/Manual/Base Set/Electrified railways|electrified railway]] without impacting trains. The track does not need to be empty.

* You can only convert tracks to track types that are currently available.

==Diagonal tracks==
In OpenTTD there can be only one type of track on each tile (except the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Railways|normal railway]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Electrified railways|electrified railway]]). You may need to rebuild your rail network first if you want to mix different types of tracks on diagonal railway lines.

==Tips==
*When converting standard tracks to electrified tracks, make sure you convert your depots to electrified tracks as well. Otherwise you will be unable to purchase new electrified engines or upgrade steam and diesel engines to electric ones.

* If you want to convert your entire rail network from standard tracks to electrified tracks, zoom out until you can see your entire network. Open the Electrified Railway Construction toolbar and click on the Convert tool. Click in one of the corners and drag to select your entire network. Release the mouse button, and your entrie network is upgraded to electrified tracks, stations, depots and bridges. '''Warning:''' If you close OpenTTD and reload your save, the Rail tool will default to standard tracks rather than electrified tracks. Make sure you switch to electrified rail to ensure any new track you lay is electrified.

* When converting to a compatible rail type (e.g. standard rail trackes to [[en/Manual/Base Set/Electrified railways|electrified tracks]]), updating trains is not immediately necessary. Steam and diesel trains can operate on electrified rails. Electrified trains, however cannot operate on non-electrified tiles. 

* Vehicle replacement ([[en/Manual/Replace vehicles#autoreplace|Autoreplace]]) between types only works for standard and electified trains. You cannot automatically replace a different train type with monorail and maglev trains.

* If you are converting from standard or electrified tracks to monorail or maglev: To save time converting a train with lots of orders from one rail type to another, send your train to a depot of the old type and [[en/Manual/Sell entire train|sell it]]. While the depot window is still open, convert the depot to the new railtype. The next train you build in the depot will have the same orders as the previous train. This only works if you keep the window open and you can only convert one train at a time using this method. You can convert the empty depot back to the old rail type to convert another train using the same depot.

* You can use the [[en/Manual/Orders#go-to|go to depot]] order for all trains that use the line you would like to convert or use the vehicle list where you can send all (or grouped) trains to the nearest depot.
