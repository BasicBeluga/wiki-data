==What is a Dedicated Server?==

A dedicated server is a program which will host an OTTD network game but will not have a client taking part in the game as with a normal server. The server program can run in the background on a machine, meaning the person who's running it doesn't even need to be there. 

==How do you run an OpenTTD Dedicated Server?==

Run openttd.exe with the "-D" switch.

==And once it's running, what then?==

You'll still have control over the game, but you will have to use the [[en/Manual/Console Commands|console commands]].
