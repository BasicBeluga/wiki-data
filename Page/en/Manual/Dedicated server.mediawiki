==What is a Dedicated Server?==

A dedicated server is a program which will host an OTTD network game but will not have a client taking part in the game as with a normal server. The server program can run in the background on a machine, meaning the person who's running it doesn't even need to be there. 

==How do you run an OpenTTD Dedicated Server?==

Run the OpenTTD executable using the "-D" switch.

How do I do that?

* In Windows:

Create a shortcut to OpenTTD.exe

Right-click -> Properties

Add "-D" onto the end of the "Target" line (without the quotes)

Click Apply

Run the shortcut

* In Windows #2

Start menu > Run

"c:\path\to\openttd\openttd.exe" -D

* In Windows #2.1

Start menu > Run
Drag the openttd.exe onto the run dialog. Now just add -D and click OK



* In Linux:

./openttd -D



* In OS/2:

Run the dedicated.cmd file. If you run "openttd -D", you will not see a console window and will be unable to provide commands to the program.

==And once it's running, what then?==

You'll still have control over the game, but you will have to use the [[en/Manual/Console Commands|console commands]].

==Configuring a Dedicated Server==

* Start OpenTTD Normally on your PC
* Set any difficulty options and other settings/patches etc to how to want them on the server
* Close OpenTTD
* Open the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]] file and go to the Network section
* Set the IP to bind to and the port, and any other options you want. Make sure to set "server_name"
* Set: server_advertise = true
and lan_internet = 0
* Copy the openttd.cfg file to your server, if it's running on a different machine
* Run OpenTTD using the -D switch

==Loading a Game onto a Dedicated Server==

After launching the server, you have 3 commands to load a game:
* 'dir' - List the files of the current directory
* 'cd <no>' - Goto dir <no> as listed with 'dir'
* 'load <no>' - Loads file <no> as listed with 'dir'

As of revision 1918 (0.4.0+) you can also load savegames with the -g <filename> command line option.
