==What is a Dedicated Server?==

A dedicated server is a program which will host an OTTD network game but will not have a client taking part in the game as with a normal server. The server program can run in the background on a machine, meaning the person who's running it doesn't even need to be there. 

==How do you run an OpenTTD Dedicated Server?==

Run openttd.exe with the "-D" switch.

==And once it's running, what then?==

You'll still have control over the game, but you will have to use the [[en/Manual/Console Commands|console commands]].

==Setting up a Dedicated Server on Windows==

* Start OpenTTD Normally on your PC
* Set any difficulty options and other settings/patches etc to how to want them on the server
* Close OpenTTD
* Open the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]] file and go to the Network section
* Set the IP to bind to and the port, and any other options you want. Make sure to set "server_name"
* Set: server_advertise = true
and lan_internet = 0
* Copy the openttd.cfg file to your server, if it's running on a different machine
* Run OpenTTD using the -D switch

==Loading a Game onto a Dedicated Server==

At the moment there is no way to do this. This feature will become available in later releases.
