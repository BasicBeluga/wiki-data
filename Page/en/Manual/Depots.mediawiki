'''Depots''' are buildings where trains, road vehicles and ships are built, stored and serviced. Aircraft use '''hangars''' which have the same function as a depot but are only available as part of an [[en/Manual/Airports]].

Depots have no limit on the size or number of [[en/Manual/Vehicles]] they can hold at one time.

==Usage==
To view inside a depot or a hangar, click on it. You will be presented with a window showing any vehicles in the depot/hangar and also a ''New Vehicles'' button to allow you to build ones. 

Clicking ''New Vehicles'' will present you with a list of available vehicles, which you may then build by clicking ''Build Vehicle''.

==Servicing==
Vehicles will periodically return to the depot to be [[en/Manual/Servicing|serviced]]. This restores the reliability rating (preventing them breaking down so often) and prolongs the working life of the vehicle.

You may put a depot on the [[en/Manual/Orders]] list for a vehicle (in the same way you would a [[en/Manual/Stations]]) to force it to be serviced at a particular point on its journey (for example before a particularly busy station where you definitely don't want it breaking down).
