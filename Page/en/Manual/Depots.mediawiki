'''Depots''' are where trains, road [[en/Manual/Vehicles]] and ships are built. It also where they go for servicing.

The depots have no limit on the number of vehicles they can hold at one time.

Railroads, ships, and road vehicles have [[en/Manual/Depots]]. Aircraft, on the other hand, have hangars.

'''Hangars''' serve the same functional purpose as depots, which is to service and construct vehicles, in this case [[en/Manual/Aircraft|airplanes]]. However, unlike depots, hangars cannot be build independently of stations. They are constructed with [[en/Manual/Airport construction|airports]], in fixed positions.

To use a depot or a hangar, click on it. You will be presented with a new window to view and manage any vehicles in the depot/hangar, or to construct new ones.
