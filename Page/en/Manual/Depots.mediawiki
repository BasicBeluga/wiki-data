'''Depots''' are where trains, road [[en/Manual/Vehicles]] and ships are built. It also where they go for servicing.

The depots have no limit on the number of vehicles they can hold at one time.

Railroads, ships, and road vehicles have depots. Aircraft, on the other hand, have hangars.

'''Hangars''' serve the same functional purpose as depots, which is to service and construct vehicles, in this case [[en/Manual/Aircraft|airplanes]]. However, unlike depots, hangars cannot be built independently of stations. They are constructed with [[en/Manual/Airports]], in fixed positions on that airport.

==Usage==
To use a depot or a hangar, click on it. You will be presented with a new window to view and manage any vehicles in the depot/hangar, or to construct new ones. To do this, click on the "New Vehicles" button, and you will be presented with a list of all the available vehicles. If a vehicle that was there before has disappeared, then the manufacturer has simply stopped producing these, and newer vehicles will be added to the list as time progresses.

With hangars, there are two different looking versions, however, each hangar still produces the same vehicles, although on smaller airports it is recommended for larger planes not to land there, as they may well crash.

Vehicles will periodically return to the depot to have [[en/Manual/Servicing]] performed on them. This prolongs the reliability rating and the working life of the vehicle.
