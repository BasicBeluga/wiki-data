[[Translation:en/Manual/Detailed Performance Rating]]
The '''Detailed Perfomance Rating''' shows the performance your company is running at, with a maximum score of 1000. There are different factors attributing to this score, with limits in most of them. For example, with [[en/Manual/Vehicles]], you can only get a maximum score of 100, for 120 vehicles.

As you progress through the score, you will be promoted to new levels, ranging from Engineer to Tycoon(the maximum). Some of these levels will cause your [[en/Archive/Manual/Headquarters]] to gain a new level.
