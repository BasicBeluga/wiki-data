If '''Disasters''' are enabled in the difficulty settings, random disasters will occasionally happen.

== Zeppelin crash ==
''1930-1955:''
A zeppelin appears on the border of the map and flies through. If the zeppelin happens to go over an airport, it will crash. The remains of the zeppelin remain on the runway, blocking this airport for half a year.

== Small UFO ==
''1940-1970:''
A small UFO will fly around, looking for one of your road vehicles. When it finds one, it will fly down, the road vehicle will break down, and be destroyed.

== Oil refinery explosion==
''1960-1990:''
A military aircraft will fly on a predetermined straight path and destroy an oil refinery. The industry will be rebuilt though, so no real harm is done. Goods production will be delayed while the industry is rebuilding.

== Factory explosion ==
''1970-2000:''
A Military Helicopter will appear on the map and travel in a straight line towards the factory on its line of movement, and will fire rockets at it, causing the factory to be destroyed, but it is rebuilt instantly, so no worries ;)

== Large UFO ==
''2000-2100:''
A large UFO will fly around, looking for a section of your railway tracks to land on. When large UFO lands, it causes every train and road vehicle nearby to break down. It will be immovable until a military aircraft appears to destroy it. The aircraft also destroys an 8x8 patch of land around the UFO to be destroyed (this only affects town buildings, trees, and unoccupied railway tracks). If you look closely on the military aircraft, you can see the X-Com sign :-) That's because it '''is''' actually the Skyranger craft from Microprose's (TTDs original producer) 1993 X-Com game.

It is possible to circument destruction by bringing a train to the UFO. The track beneath the train and the train itself will not be destroyed.

== Small submarine ==
''1940-1965:''Don't believe the rumours they destroy ships or oil rigs - they don't (although that may have been the original concept). They are more spoofs from X-Com, which was coming out at the time. This is the small submarine, which is just visually smaller. It's quite rare, too.

== Large submarine ==
''1975-2010'' Don't believe the rumours they destroy ships or oil rigs - they don't (although that may have been the original concept). They are more spoofs from X-Com, which was coming out at the time. The larger Submarine is notably larger and a little less rare.

== Coal mine subsidence ==
''1950-1985:''
A shaft at a coal mine will collapse. Anything on a line, extending a random number of squares, will be destroyed - railway tracks, trees, farmland, town buildings, etc.
