Drive-through road stops (DTRS) make available a new kind of station for road vehicles.  Much like a traditional real-life "bus stop", these new stations allow RVs to load/unload passengers and cargo simply by stopping by the side of the road, then continue along the road out the other side of the station.  These stations greatly increase the efficiency of road vehicles.

DTRS can be on existing town roads (eliminating the need for a open plot of land on which to build a station), or can be built from scratch (both station and new stretch of road will be built).  When built on existing roads, the stretch of road will retain its initial ownership if the station is later removed.  When built from scratch, the road created remains in the control of the player, even if the station is later bulldozed.

'''To build a Drive-through road stop:'''
#Open the road station menu as normal
#Click on the drive-through graphic[[File:en/Manual/DriveThru Menu.gif|none]]
#Either find an open plot of land, or find an existing stretch of road to build the station on[[File:en/Manual/DriveThru Placement.gif|none]]

*Using the dynamite tool on a DTRS will remove both the station and the road, if you are allowed to remove the road. If not, the dynamite button will do nothing.  Using the remove/bulldoze tool will remove only the station and leave the road
*Several stations can be built in sequence, and RVs arriving at the station will automatically load at the furthest open location, leaving nearer stations open to later-arriving vehicles
*DTRS are available from nightly build r8735 on.  They are not yet available in any release version, but are planned for inclusion in version 0.6.0
