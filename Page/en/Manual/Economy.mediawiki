==Share trading==
In single player once a company has started selling its shares you may buy them 25% at a time by paying 1/4 of the company's labeled value. You may then sell them at a later date when the company's value has increased for a profit, or buy 100% to take over the company. In doing so you will gain all of the company's vehicles, but also their debt.

Note that for multiplayer games, you can only buy 75% of a company. There is no way to take over a rival company (run by a human).
