==Is it possible to use the operating system cursor instead of the sluggish OpenTTD cursor?==
It is possible, with a few minor changes to the code, but at the moment there is no option for it. Alternatively, you might code a [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] to do it.

==How do I relocate the menubar and status bar, since it's 'centered' on a dual-display?==

==How to get expired vehicles back?==
After 2050 vehicles expire, which means they are no longer available for you. That is really bad if you want to open a new service!

* The general solution to this problem is to enable the '[[en/Manual/Vehicles#vehicles-never-expire|vehicles never expire]]' option from the advanced settings, '''before you start a game'''.
* If you are already playing, and you don't want to start a new game, you can get your vehicles back '''in this game only''' by
*# Enable the '[[en/Manual/Vehicles#vehicles-never-expire|vehicles never expire]]' option from the advanced settings.
*# Type 'resetengines' in the in-game [[en/Manual/Console]].
