==How to make (good) profits==
:* Observe 'Cargo payment rates' (under chart icon [[File:en/Manual/Manual html 36354981.png]]) to see what will give you good profit
:* Search for large cities (in Town directory [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m58c015ad.png]]) and/or industries that have greatest production (in Industry directory [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m4d6ba21e.png]])
:* Build long routes, try to keep them flat and without many turns (to maximize speed)
:* Use '[[en/Manual/Orders#full-load|Full load]]' in vehicle order

==There is no cargo at my stations!==
By default, cargo from industries is not delivered to stations until a demand exists.
In other words, until you send a vehicle to the station for getting the cargo, none will appear.
The reason for this behaviour is that it prevents you from getting bad ratings due to perishing of cargoes you don't want to transport at all.

In the advanced settings, you can switch between this behaviour and the case where all cargoes are always delivered to stations.

==Why does cargo at my stations disappear?==
That happens when you are not providing a good service to the stations. Below a tress-hold of the station rating, cargo perishes after some time.

To fix this problem, increase the rating. See also the answer to the next question.

==How to maximize 'Local rating of transport service'==
:Read about [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#station-rating|station rating]] and [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#local-authority-rating|town rating]].

==How to disable opening and closing of industries==
:[http://grfcrawler.tt-forums.net/details.php?do=details&id=244 Manual Industries]

A newer version for OpenTTD, 1.1.x (currently, nightlies only) is available as ''Manual Industries'' in bananas, the online content system.

==Is it possible to use the operating system cursor instead of the sluggish OpenTTD cursor?==
It is possible, with a few minor changes to the code, but at the moment there is no option for it. Alternatively, you might code a [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] to do it.

==How do I relocate the main toolbar and statusbar, since it's 'centred' on a dual-display?==
In [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Interface]] there are options to set the position of the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Interface#position-of-the-main-toolbar|main toolbar]] and the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Interface#position-of-statusbar|statusbar]] to left, centre or right.

==How to get expired vehicles back?==
After 2050 vehicles expire, which means they are no longer available for you. That is really bad if you want to open a new service!

See the page [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Never expire vehicles]] on how to avoid that.

==How long is a game day in real time?==
One game day takes 2220ms (2.22 seconds) real time. A game year thus takes 810.3 seconds, or 13.505 minutes.

==Why are my vehicles not serviced?==
Make sure that:
* breakdowns are on.
* servicing when breakdowns are off is off.
* the depot is within 20 routing units from the path your vehicle is following. Note: This includes road crossings, signals and other obstacles.

==How to get computer opponents (AIs) in my game?==
Starting with version 0.7.0, the default computer opponent has been removed.
As a replacement, you can now download opponents from the online content system, or even develop your own AI opponent!
See
* The [[en/Manual/AI settings]] page describes how to download and activate opponents.
* The [[en/Development/Script/Main Page]] describes how to program your own opponents.
