:* Observe 'Cargo payment rates' (under chart icon [[File:en/Manual/Manual html 36354981.png]]) to see what will give you good profit
:* Search for large cities (in Town directory [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m58c015ad.png]]) and/or industries that have greatest production (in Industry directory [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m4d6ba21e.png]])
:* Build long routes, try to keep them flat and without many turns (to maximize speed)

==How to maximize 'Local rating of transport service'==
:Read about [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#station-rating|station rating]] and [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#local-authority-rating|town rating]].

==How to disable opening and closing of industries==
:[http://grfcrawler.tt-forums.net/details.php?do=details&id=244 Manual Industries]

A newer version for OpenTTD, 1.1.x (currently, nightlies only) is available as ''Manual Industries'' in bananas, the online content system.

==Is it possible to use the operating system cursor instead of the sluggish OpenTTD cursor?==
It is possible, with a few minor changes to the code, but at the moment there is no option for it. Alternatively, you might code a [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] to do it.

==How do I relocate the menubar and status bar, since it's 'centred' on a dual-display?==
In [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Interface]] there are options to set the position of the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Interface#position-of-the-main-toolbar|main toolbar]] and the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Interface#position-of-statusbar|statusbar]] to left, centre or right.

==How to get expired vehicles back?==
After 2050 vehicles expire, which means they are no longer available for you. That is really bad if you want to open a new service!

See the page [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Never expire vehicles]] on how to avoid that.

==How long is a game day in real time?==
One game day takes 2220ms (2.22 seconds) real time. A game year thus takes 810.3 seconds, or 13.505 minutes.

==Why are my vehicles not serviced?==
Make sure that:
* breakdowns are on.
* servicing when breakdowns are off is off.
* the depot is within 20 routing units from the path your vehicle is following. Note: This includes road crossings, signals and other obstacales.
