[[Translation:en/Manual/FAQ multiplayer]]
== Then and now ==

In TTD, multiplayer wasn't stable, it was hard to get working, and, with the patch, you couldn't transfer keystrokes, and there could only be 2 competing players. Thus, there was no good way to play a decent multiplayer game with you're friends.

Now, multiplayer is as good as stable, quite easy to get working, and everything can be transferred. Also, there are big map versions out, so you don't get cramped with you're competitors. Also, there is some new feautures; up to 8 players and cooperative gameplay.

== The command line way ==

In the [[en/Manual/Command line]], you can use the following options:

{| border="1"
|+ Network Protocol
|-
! Code !! Params !! Description !! Example
|-
| -m || IP || This tells OpenTTD to start a multiplayer game. You use IP, ([http://www.whatismyip.com What is my ip?]) to connect to a server, where IP is replaced by the hosts IP (He must have started the game with -m first). If you want to test if it works and if you got it right, then you start a game with -m and a second game with -m 127.0.0.1, that will make you join you're own game (127.0.0.1 is localhost) || 
-m 10.10.101.10 or -m |
|-
| -p || Player ID || With this, you can make coop games, sort of, where multiple players control the same company. Replace "Player ID" with the number of the player. Start counting from the top of the player list. 

This is also useful for re-joining network games that you have become de-synchronised from for whatever reason. (some patience may be required to get a good reconnect) Just remember that in-game player numbers go from 1-8 and the commandline option is from 0-7 so subtract one from the in-game number.

Don't join an AI, it'll go nuts.

== The mp console way ==

== Some stuff about the config file... ==

Before starting a MP game, make sure all players have the same config file. It is not automatically synched (yet).
