[[Translation:en/Manual/FAQ multiplayer]]
== Then and now ==

In TTD, multiplayer wasn't stable, it was hard to get working, and, whit the patch, you couldnt transfer keystrokes, and there could only be 2 competing pleyers. Thus, there was no good way to get a go whit youre friends.

Now, multiplayer is as good as stable, quite easy to get working, and everything ccan be transferred. Also, there are big map versions out, so you don't get cramped whit youre competitor. Also, there is some new feautures; up to 8 players and cooperate playing.

In the commandline ([[en/Comandline?]]), you can use the following ways:

! Code !! Params !! Description !! Example

| -m || IP || This tells OTTD to start a multiplayer game. You use IP, ([http://www.whatismyip.com What is my ip?]) to connect to a server, where IP is replaced by the hosts IP (He must have startede the game whit -m first). If you want to test if it works and if you got it right, then you start a game whit -m and a secound game whit -m 127.0.0.1, that'll start wil make you join youre own game (127.0.0.1 is localhost) || 
-m 10.10.101.10 or -m |

| -p || Player ID || Whit this, you can make coop games, sort of, where multiple players control the same compeny. Replace "Player ID" whit the number of the player. Start counting from the top of the player list. Don't join an AI, it'll go nuts. || -p 2 ||
