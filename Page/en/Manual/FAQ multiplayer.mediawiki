[[Translation:en/Manual/FAQ multiplayer]]
== Then and now ==

In TTD, multiplayer wasn't stable, it was hard to get working, and, with the patch, you couldn't transfer keystrokes, and there could only be 2 competing players. Thus, there was no good way to play a decent multiplayer game with your friends.

Now, multiplayer is as good as stable, quite easy to get working, and everything can be transferred. Also, there are big map versions out, so you don't get cramped with your competitors. Also, there is some new feautures; up to 8 players and cooperative gameplay.

== The command line way ==

In the [[en/Manual/Command line]], you can use the following options:

{| border="1"
|+ Network Protocol
|-
! Code !! Params !! Description !! Example
|-
| -n || IP[:port][#playerID] || This allows you to join a network game from the commandline. IP is an IP or a hostname (e.g.: localhost, or 127.0.0.1 (both joins a local game)). When port is ommited, the default port is used. When PlayerID is ommited, the client joins as a new player (if available). You can join any player by entering a PlayerID between 1 and 8 (where 1 is the first player). This enables you to do a coop-game (where 2 clients join the same player). Also, when you left the game for some reason, you can go back and take control again of your company. (this is also possible from in-game with the Direct Connect button. The same params are accepted (IP[:port][#playerID]) || -n 10.10.101.10#1 (connects to 10.10.101.10 and joins as player 1)
|}

== The mp console way ==

== Some stuff about the config file... ==

Before starting a MP game, make sure all players have the same config file. It is not automatically synched (yet).
