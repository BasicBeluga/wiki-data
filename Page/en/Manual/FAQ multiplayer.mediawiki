This FAQ covers questions regarding the multiplayer capabilities of OpenTTD.

__FORCETOC__
=====Does multiplayer really work?=====
:* Yes, multiplayer is stable since version 0.3.5. Up until that version it was almost impossible to play multiplayer games due to the bad network design of the original TTD.

=====How many players can join an OpenTTD game?=====
:* Up to 10 players can participate in a multiplayer game. You can only open up 8 companies though. Each player can either play his own company, join another company (cooperative gameplay) or watch a game (spectator mode).

=====How do I start a multiplayer game?=====
:* You can either do that through the [[en/Manual/Multiplayer]] or by using the following command line syntax:
<pre>openttd -n IP[:port][#playerID]</pre>
Example:
<pre>openttd 192.168.0.1:3979#1</pre> would connect to 192.168.0.1 on port 3979 and joins as player 1.

=====What port does OpenTTD use?=====
:* the default port is 3979, but you can change it to anything you like when you start a server.
