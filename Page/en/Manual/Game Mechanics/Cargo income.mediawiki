==Overview==

The amount of money earned when delivering a [[en/Manual/Cargo]] is determined by four factors: cargo, amount, distance, and days in transit, and is the product of the cargo payment rate, amount of cargo, transit distance, and time factor determined by days in transit.

The transit distance is measured as the [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan distance manhattan distance] between the origin station and the destination station.

The time scaler penalizes slow transportation. Each cargo type has two numbers, days1 and days2, that determine the boundaries between "fast", "medium", and "slow".
