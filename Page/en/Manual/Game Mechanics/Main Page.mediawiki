Here you can find information about how OpenTTD calculates in-game figures.

You always wanted to know how the station-rating was built up? How goods-distribution works? Here you can find it!

==Player rating==

Each part of the player rating is a linear function, ie. earning 50% of the target for a component will give 50% of the points allocated for that component. Where components involve monetary amounts, these are converted to the currency of the current game; internally these amounts are stored as the pound amount.

</td></tr></table>

Each month players' ratings automatically change:
* Rating goes up by 5 if it is less than 200.
* Rating goes up by 12 for each station that has transferred cargo in the last 20 days.
* Rating goes down by 15 for each station that has not transferred cargo in the last 20 days.


'''Example:'''<br>
A player has a rating of -300, (Very Poor), 2 active stations and 1 unactive station at a town.<br>
5pts + 2 * 12pts - 15pts = 14pts points gain per month.<br>
(-200 - -300)pts / 14pts/mo = 8 months before the town will let him build another station.

Code for town ratings is in town.h, town_cmd.c, tree_cmd.c, and road_cmd.c.

==Industry production==
Here is how the game determines how much cargo an industry produces per month.  This section lists production governed by the default [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Economy#enable-smooth-economy|smooth economy]] patch.  Production is a multiple of 8 or 9 (sometimes 10 with forests).

Each month the game randomly changes some industry productions:
*There is a 4.5% chance for a production change each month.  
*Out of those 4.5% if industries are not connected (lack of any service or poor service - <60%) chance of increase is 33% - industries are gradually (mainly) decreasing production because they cannot sustain their operation (no or not enough revenue - to pay the workers etc.) - till their closure.
*When there is interest for the industry/good transport service (>60%) there is a 67% (out of those 4.5%) chance for increase of production due to good service.
*Production changes per month with smooth economy are random, between 3 and 23%, more for very low productions of 12-40 tonnes per month.
*If the service achieves excellent or outstanding ratings, industry tries to fill the increased demand for cargo.
*Maximum production is 2040 or 2195 units of cargo per month (= 8x or 9x 255).


'''Example:'''<br>
A coal mine has 70% of its output transported:<br>
Percent of transported cargo is over 60% (very good service), so there's 3% chance for 3-23% (random) increase.<br>
Of course due to unforseen circumstances, the production can also go down (1.5% chance) for 3-23%.<br>
(1+ 1.5% * 13%(average change)) ^ 12 ~ 102%, the coal mine will grow an average of 2% per year.
