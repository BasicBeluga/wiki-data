The status bar can be found at the bottom of page, as can be seen in picture 1., and above in picture 3. It is divided into three sections. 
*On the left you can see the date. It progresses as the time goes by. If you have the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Long date in status bar]] [[en/Community/Patches/Patches]] enabled you will see the full date there too, not just the current month, even when the game is paused.
*The middle part, which takes up most of the space, shows various information. 
**First of all, it shows the name of your company, currently '''''"- - Unnamed - -"'''''. After you [[en/Manual/Transport company]] it will show that name. 
**This is also the place where [[en/Archive/Manual/News messages]] will pop up, informing you of various events. If you have accidentally closed the news message, or it was closed after some time, clicking this bar will bring it back. 
**If you have changed the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Message settings]] to ''"summary"'' mode, all news messages will scroll by here instead of popping up.
**It also shows if the game is paused by saying: '''''* * PAUSED * *'''''
*The right part shows your current finances; your money. You can change the currency in the [[en/Manual/Game options window]] accessible by pressing the ''"Options"'' button in the menu bar and then ''"Game Options"''.
