OpenTTD allows you to write your own Game Scripts. These scripts can provide goals for all companies, inspect properties of all companies and also communicate with the players of companies.

= How to get started =
When you write a Game Script, you code it in a programming language called Squirrel. The framework used for GameScripts is called NoGo and share many aspects with the AI framework called NoAI.

For historical reasons there are plenty of wiki articles on how to write AIs, but very few with the Game Script perspective. Thankfully Game Scripts are very similar to AIs only that they don't have ownership of a specific company. Thus the AI articles are still of great help on how to write Game Scripts. 

* Read the [[en/Development/Script/Main Page|AI section]] (lots of material apply to Game Scripts too)
* [http://nogo.openttd.org/api/ NoGo (GameScript) API documents]
* [http://www.squirrel-lang.org/doc/squirrel2.html Squirrel documentation]
* [http://bananas.openttd.org/en/gs/ Download a game script] and read the code to see how it works

When working with your GS, don't store it in $OpenTTD/online_content/game. Instead store it in $OpenTTD/game. Make a directory there for your GS eg. $OpenTTD/game/myGS and put the .nut files in there.
