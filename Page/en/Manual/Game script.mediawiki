[[Translation:en/Manual/Game script]]
OpenTTD allows you to write your own Game Scripts. These scripts can provide goals for all companies, inspect properties of all companies and also communicate with the players of companies.

{{en/Feature|1.2}}

{{en/Manual/Navigation}}

Gamescript or NoGo provides the possibility of adding goal-based scripts to the game via a framework similar to the NoAI framework using the Squirrel programming language.

'Gamescripts' can modify the way towns behave, delete objects, place new in-game industries, and town buildings, as well as inquire about the state of the game, and do several other in-game actions.  Gamescript files may be downloaded and selected for activation prior to creation of a new game in order to introduce these features. Unlike [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings]] which may be changed part way through a game, Gamescripts should be installed prior to starting a new game in order to ensure correct operation. Gamescripts are not supported by [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]], and are introduced, and supported by, openTTD version 1.2.0 and later.

==Getting Gamescripts==
=== Online content ===
The most common and convenient way to obtain gamescripts is by using the ingame [[en/Manual/Online content|online content download]] feature. Most Gamescripts can be found there. There exists also a Gamescript [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=65|development forum] where you may find development versions of some gamescripts.
===Manual install===
If you want to use gamescripts installed from other locations, which are not available from the online content download, you need to manually install them into the correct place. A gamescript is either a tarball or .tar file, or a directory with several code files. To install a gamescript:
#Download the gamescript file(s).
#Move (and uncompress) the gamescript file(s) to the gamescript directory of your OpenTTD installation.
:*This will often be:
::C:\My Documents\game (Windows 95, 98, ME)
::C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\My Documents\OpenTTD\game (Windows 2000, XP)
::C:\Users\<username>\Documents\OpenTTD\game (Windows Vista, 7)
::~/.openttd/game (Linux, BSD)
::~/Documents/OpenTTD/game (OSX)

==Activating Gamescripts==

1.   In the main menu, click "AI/Gamescript Settings".

2.   Select the text in the box under "Gamescript"

3.   Click the top-left-most button in the bottom menu labeled "Select Gamescript"

4.   Pick a gamescript of your choice from the pop-up menu.

==Setting Gamescript parameters==

1.   In the main menu, click "AI/Gamescript Settings".

2.   Select the text in the box under "Gamescript"

3.   Click the 'Configure' button. 

4.   A row of parameters defined by the gamescript will show up. Change the desired parameters and click the 'Close' button to implement the changes. Use the 'Reset' button to set all parameters back to default values.

= Writing your own game script =
When you write a Game Script, you code it in a programming language called Squirrel. The framework used for GameScripts is called NoGo and share many aspects with the AI framework called NoAI.

For historical reasons there are plenty of wiki articles on how to write AIs, but very few with the Game Script perspective. Thankfully Game Scripts are very similar to AIs only that they don't have ownership of a specific company. Thus the AI articles are still of great help on how to write Game Scripts. 

* Read the [[en/Development/Script/Main Page|AI section]] (lots of material apply to Game Scripts too)
See the external links below for more sources.

When working with your GS, don't store it in $OpenTTD/online_content/game. Instead store it in $OpenTTD/game. Make a directory there for your GS eg. $OpenTTD/game/myGS and put the .nut files in there.
