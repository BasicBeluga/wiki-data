[[Translation:en/Manual/Heightmap]]
A '''heightmap''' is a computer image that can be used to generate maps based on pixel brightness (See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap wikipedia]).

==Using Heightmaps==
Heightmap can be considered a grayscale image where bright white ('''#FFFFFF'''), is considered as highest point of map, and black ('''#000000'''), is considered as lowest point of map. Look [[#grayscale-table]] from below for more more accurate info.

On 1:1 image to map conversion, one pixel in image file represents corner of 4 tiles. Therefore, if you wish to lower/rise whole tile, you need to make 2x2 pixels brighter/darker enough than surrounding pixels.

Since edges of map must be at sea level at least one tile, heightmap border can be seen as 2 pixels width.

===Supported file formats===
* BMP
* PNG

===Example===
{|align="left" border="0"
|[[File:en/Manual/Heightmap img.png|none|frame|If you create heightmap from this file...]]
|[[File:en/Manual/Heightmap map.png|none|thumb|... this is what you get]]
|}
<br clear="all" />
