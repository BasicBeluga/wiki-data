Here is a list of little features, which are very helpful, but not necessarily obvious even to experienced OTTD players. Feel free to complete this list.

=CTRL features=
Press CTRL and click on the game element...
* finances window: "borrow" button. Borrow maximum loan possible.
* finances window: "repay" button. Repay maximum loan amount possible, depending on available cash.
* orders window: order sharing and copying ("goto" on other vehicle to copy, ctrl+"goto" to share)
* depot window: if you are cloning a train, clone the train with "shared orders" rather than just copy the existing orders.
* depot window: drag the whole train or large parts of the train with ctrl in depot
* (win32 build) double size mode (Ctrl-d to toggle, only available in windowed mode though)
* railway construction: signal button will place semaphores instead of light signals if there are no signals on the tile already.
* scenario editor: remove desert with desert tool
* orders window: clicking on the order will scroll you over the station/waypoint/depot given in order
