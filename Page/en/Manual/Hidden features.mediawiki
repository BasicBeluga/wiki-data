[[Translation:en/Manual/Hidden features]]
There are many features within OpenTTD with no GUI buttons or easily accessible to operate. To the most inexperienced of users, these are '''Hidden Features'''.

Here is a list of the hidden features, which are helpful, but not necessarily obvious even to experienced OTTD players. Feel free to complete this list.

=CTRL features=
Press CTRL and click on the game element...
* Finances window: "borrow" button. Borrow maximum loan possible.
* Finances window: "repay" button. Repay maximum loan amount possible, depending on available cash.
* Orders window: [[en/Manual/Orders|order sharing]] and [[en/Manual/Orders|copying orders]] ("goto" on other vehicle to copy, ctrl + "goto" to share)
* Depot window: if you are cloning a train, clone the train with "[[en/Manual/Orders|shared orders]]" rather than just copy the existing orders.
* Depot window: drag the whole train or large parts of the train with ctrl in depot
* Double size mode: Ctrl-D to toggle, only available in windowed mode though (Windows Build Only)
* Railway construction: Ctrl + "signal button" will place semaphores instead of light signals if there are no signals on the tile already.
* Scenario editor: remove desert with desert tool
* Orders window: clicking on the order will scroll you over the station/waypoint/depot given in order

=More features=
* mouse wheel for list scrolling or map zooming
* press x to toggle transparent mode
* cost estimation with "shift" key. Works almost everywhere.
* Bridge upgrades: Build a new bridge over the old bridge to upgrade it. If upgrading a town bridge the new bridge must have a higher top speed, but otherwise it can be anything you like.
