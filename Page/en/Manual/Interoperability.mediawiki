It is possible to load TTD/TTDPatch games in OpenTTD. Look in the list below for further details.

==Transport Tycoon Deluxe savegames==
You can load any TTD savegame into OpenTTD. Possible extensions:
* *.sv1 - Transport Tycoon Deluxe saved game
* *.sv2 - Transport Tycoon Deluxe saved multiplayer game (2 players)
* *.ss1 - Transport Tycoon Deluxe preset game (included on TTDLX CD)
'''Note''': The extension must be lower case on Unix systems!

==Transport Tycoon Deluxe scenarios==
Most scenarios should work. Copy them into the /scenario directory using the following extensions:
* *.sv0 - Transport Tycoon Deluxe scenario
* *.ss0 - Transport Tycoon Deluxe preset scenario (included on TTDLX CD)
'''Note''': Again, extension must be lower case on Unix systems!

==TTDpatch savegames==
<warning>Not all TTDpatch savegames can be loaded into OpenTTD!</warning> This depends very much on which patches you activated while playing TTDpatch. Some patches, like [[en/Manual/Signals]] work in OpenTTD as well, but other patches might not be loaded correctly in OpenTTD.
