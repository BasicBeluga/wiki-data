==What do all those buttons do?==
The buttons are self-explanatory. From left to right:<br>

:*[[File:en/Manual/Lower land.png]] '''[[en/Manual/Landscaping]] button'''

==Raising Land==
Raising land is achieved through use of [[File:en/Manual/Raise land.png]]. This button will let you raise a point or section of land. Simply select the tool then click on the desired location. Beware though, the higher the land gets, the wider the base of the mountain will become, increasing any disrespect from Local Authorities. The expense is not for the height, but for the volume of change. Avoid raising land from the sea, as it is extremely expensive and can bankrupt young companies.

==Lowering Land==
Lowering land is achieved through use of [[File:en/Manual/Lower land.png]]. This button will let you lower a point or section of land. As with raising land, simply select the tool and click on the desirsed location. Land can only be lowered to sea level, and no lower. Beware, as areas at sea level are prone to flooding, and all tiles will be washed away (apart from ones with vehicles present, like a busy airport or train depot).

==How to level land==
If you want to flatten land over a large area you should use the level land button.

:1. Start by clicking and holding down the mouse where you want to start.
::*The height of the levelled land will be the same height as the tile you started on.


:2. Then drag the mouse over area you want to level (Fig 2).

:3. When satisfied with the area, release the button and the area should then be levelled (Fig 3).

:4. Levelling can be used also in mass scale to flat the whole map. This also annoys a lot of players in multiplayer games, so it is not recommended. And of course, it costs enormous sums of money.
