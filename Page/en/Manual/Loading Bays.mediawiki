[[Translation:en/Manual/Loading Bays]]
'''Loading bays''' are loading and unloading points for road vehicles. There are two loading bays, one being for buses and passengers, and the other for lorries and goods.

==Bus Loading Bay==

A single Bus Station can handle at most two buses at once (trucks will be handled by ). Other buses will be waiting on the road before the station. This can cause (temporary) lockups, which are almost unavoidable. However, by using the multistop feature, bus stations can handle a much higher capacity of traffic as buses will try and pick an empty station square instead of blocking up a busy station. There are no limits to the number of buses you can send to a single station.

==Lorry Loading Bay==

Lorry Stations are identical to Bus Stations except they handle lorries instead of buses. A single lorry station can handle at most two trucks at once. However, in OpenTTD, multiple truck stations can be joined using the multistop feature.

While in-efficient compared to railways, the lorries in OpenTTD are cheap to run, and can turn a profit if using correctly. It is possible to run a company using only road vehicles.

==Multistop==
Multistop is a way to build for example 2 or more bus stations or lorry stations next to each other, while sharing the same station name and cargo. Buses and trucks will go for empty other stops if the nearest one is full.

Multistop stations can be built to a maximum size of 8 stations before becoming too large. If you try and add extra stops, a warning will be issued. This limit is based on a mixed station. In Fig 9. above; 4 truck stops and 4 bus stations combine to reach the maximum limit.
