[[Translation:en/Manual/Local authority]]
The local authority is the goverment that controls each area of the map. In openTTD it seems that every governemt is populated by liberal environmentalist hippy types that get outraged when you destroy even one little tree. The kind of people who have not realized yet that corporations are in control of the world and even the most idealistic leader can be persuaded to your point of view, for the right price. 

==Area of Influence==
The local authority controls a certain area around it's city. It also controls any land the city has expanded to include and the land that its industries are on. Changing terrain, exploding trees or buildings, planting trees, actions, and performance of stations in this area will change the attitude of the local authority. Having a poor rating will affect what you are allowed to build in the area controlled by the local authority. Normally there is only one industry of each type allowed  under a local authority. This can be [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Multiple industries per town|changed]].

==Ratings==
The rating is the local authority's attitude toward each company. This is not the same (AFAIK) as station ratings. This rating determine's what actions will be allowed in the area and not whether your transport services will be used as opposed to a competitor.
More technical information about this can be found in [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page|Game Mechanics]].
==Actions==
These actions are avalable in the Local Authority window provided you have enough money.

===Advertising===
Advertising campaigns attract more customers to your transport services and away from the competition.

===Build Statue===
Build a statue in honor of your company. This will increase your station ratings at stations in the area.

===Fund New Buildings===
Funds new commercial buildings. Like funding a new industry, you won't get any return on your investment except the added customers for your service. (No rent, shared profits, or anything like that.)

===Road Reconstruction===
Fund the reconstruction of the urban road network. Causes considerable disruption to road traffic for up to six months. Use this to piss off the other players in multiplayer. There is no other benefit. (The trucks don't go any faster after the roads are re-built.)

===Buy Exclusive Transport Rights===
Buys a year's exclusive transport rights in the area of the local authority. Passengers and cargo will only be allowed to use your transport services during that time.

===Pass a Bribe===
Bribe the local authority to increase your rating at the risk of a severe penalty if caught. This option is not available if your rating is already high. If you are caught by the [[en/Archive/Manual/Regional Investigator|regional investigator]] you will not be able to transport any cargo from the area for six months. The [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Bribe authority|bribe patch]] must be enabled.

==The City==
The city is the center of the local authority's area of influence.
The city needs passenger service to grow. Goods grow the city as well. In the tropical climate, a city in the desert will also require food and water. In the sub-arctic climate, a city in the snowy mountains, will require food.
