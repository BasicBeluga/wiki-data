'''OpenTTD''' is an [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source open source] clone of the Microprose game [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Tycoon Transport Tycoon Deluxe (TTD)]. 

You play the role of president of a start-up transport company in 1950, building railway, road, air and maritime transportation systems for commodities and people. The goal of the game is to outsmart your competition and become the game's highest-ranking transport company by the year 2050.

OpenTTD runs on Mac, Linux, Windows, Unix, BeOS, OS/2 and a few other [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Operating system|platforms]].

==Features==
While the game is modeled after the original by [http://www.chrissawyer.com/info.htm Chris Sawyer], OpenTTD has many additional features that enhance gameplay dramatically. OpenTTD has customizable game graphics, and work is underway to replace TTD's graphics completely.

==History of Transport Tycoon==
The first Transport Tycoon (TT) game was released in 1994. It was developed by [http://www.chrissawyer.com/ Chris Sawyer] and released by MicroProse. 
It was very popular at the time. Compared to many other games of the time, it was spectacular. The intuitive gameplay and the colourful, crisp graphics, combined with endless opportunities to build and shape the railway network of your dreams made it a winner.
With the release of Transport Tycoon Deluxe (TTD) in 1995, the game was greatly improved. Many new features, including 4 different environments, maglev trains, one-way signals, etc, were implemented.
TTD continued to be played for many years after by a small, but fanatic bunch of gamers. Even though the game had been fairly successful, no sequel was announced.

===The rise of TTDPatch===
Somewhere around 1996-1997, Josef Drexler started a project called [http://www.ttdpatch.net/ TTDPatch], which was (as the name implies) a patch for TTD. Originally it only did small things, but later on it was able to support [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] files, two company colours, and even trams. It fixes some problems with the game and also adds a lot of new features to it. The TTDPatch project has endured for many years and has changed the game quite radically.

===A Windows version===
A great problem during 1996 was that TTD had been written in assembly language and was not especially portable. Nevertheless, a Windows 95 conversion was made by FISH Technology Group in 1996, but it was only released by Microprose (later Hasbro Interactive) in 1999, in a Tycoon compilation known as "The Tycoon Collection", including Railroad Tycoon 2, Rollercoaster Tycoon, and Transport Tycoon Deluxe. This Windows version introduced a few bugs, including broken tutorials, and had a FISH UK logo added to the startup screens (removed from OpenTTD).

===Enter OpenTTD===
''The Patch's'' method of modifying the game deemed a lot of potential features as near-impossible. [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Ludde]] contacted [http://www.tt-forums.net/ Owen Rudge] in 2003, and explained he was going to reverse engineer the game and convert TTD to [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/C (programming language) C]. A year later Ludde surprisingly presented Owen Rudge with the first [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release release]. Forums were created where people discussed the new incarnation of the game. Response was positive, and other developers joined Ludde in the project.  Work continues on OpenTTD to this day.
