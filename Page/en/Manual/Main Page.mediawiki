'''OpenTTD''' is an [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source open source] clone of the Microprose game [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Tycoon Transport Tycoon Deluxe (TTD)]. As president of a start-up transportation company in 1950, you have a choice of building rail, road, air and maritime transportation routes to build up your transportation empire. Outsmart your competition by beating them to attractive passenger and commodities routes to become the game's highest-ranking transport company by the year 2050.

OpenTTD is based on [http://www.chrissawyer.com/info.htm Chris Sawyer's Transport Tycoon Deluxe] and introduces a whole set of new features, including multiplayer support, better stations and vehicles, larger maps and a host of other options. OpenTTD runs on Mac OS X, Linux, Unix, BeOS, OS/2, Windows and a few other [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Operating system|platforms]].

==Features==
:''Main Article: [[en/Archive/Lists/List of New Features]]''

While the game is modelled after the original, OpenTTD has many additional features that enhance gameplay dramatically. OpenTTD has customizable game graphics, and work is underway to replace TTD's graphics completely. Many features were inspired by [http://www.ttdpatch.net/ TTDPatch], a popular enhancement for TTD, while other features are original. OpenTTD is far more customisable than Transport Tycoon deluxe through the use of [[en/Community/Patches/Patches]] and [[en/Manual/NewGRF|custom graphics]].

Significant enhancements include the introduction of [[en/Manual/Multiplayer]], railways tracks built with the [[en/Archive/Manual/Autorail]] tool and [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|on slopes]], [[en/Manual/Waypoints]], trains that are [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Mammoth trains|longer]] with [[en/Archive/Manual/Multiheaded trains|more engines]] and larger and more realistic maps. More advanced players can take advantage of [[en/Manual/Signals]] for more control over stations and junctions, an increase in the number of allowed vehicles, and [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Nonuniform stations|more flexibility]] when it comes to stations.

To make the game more enjoyable, [[en/Archive/Manual/Yet Another PBS Patch|new train pathfinders]] have been added to let trains find their way better, a [[en/Manual/Convert rail|convert rail]] tool to make upgrading easier and a bigger dynamite tool to make blowing things up a lot faster.

There are many more features that are present in OpenTTD, and more are added all the time. For a complete list of new features, go to the [[en/Archive/Lists/List of New Features]].

==History of Transport Tycoon==
The first Transport Tycoon (TT) game was released in 1994. It was developed by [http://www.chrissawyer.com/ Chris Sawyer] and released by MicroProse. 
It was very popular at the time. Compared to many other games of the time, it was spectacular. The intuitive gameplay and the colourful, crisp graphics, combined with endless opportunities to build and shape the railway network of your dreams made it a winner.
With the release of Transport Tycoon Deluxe (TTD) in 1995, the game was greatly improved. Many new features, including 4 different environments, maglev trains, one-way signals, etc, were implemented.
TTD continued to be played for many years after by a small, but fanatic bunch of gamers. Even though the game had been fairly successful, no sequel was announced.

===The rise of TTDPatch===
Somewhere around 1996-1997, Josef Drexler started a project called [http://www.ttdpatch.net/ TTDPatch], which was (as the name implies) a patch for TTD. Originally it only did small things, but later on it was able to support [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] files, two company colours, and even trams. It fixes some problems with the game and also adds a lot of new features to it. The TTDPatch project has endured for many years and has changed the game quite radically.

===A Windows version===
A great problem during 1996 was that TTD had been written in assembly language and was not especially portable. Nevertheless, a Windows 95 conversion was made by FISH Technology Group in 1996, but it was only released by Microprose (later Hasbro Interactive) in 1999, in a Tycoon compilation known as "The Tycoon Collection", including Railroad Tycoon 2, Rollercoaster Tycoon, and Transport Tycoon Deluxe. This Windows version introduced a few bugs, including broken tutorials, and had a FISH UK logo added to the startup screens (removed from OpenTTD).

===Enter OpenTTD===
''The Patch's'' method of modifying the game deemed a lot of potential features as near-impossible. [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Ludde]] contacted [http://www.tt-forums.net/ Owen Rudge] in 2003, and explained he was going to reverse engineer the game and convert TTD to [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/C (programming language) C]. A year later Ludde surprisingly presented Owen Rudge with the first [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release release]. Forums were created where people discussed the new incarnation of the game. Response was positive, and other developers joined Ludde in the project.  Work continues on OpenTTD to this day.
