'''OpenTTD''' is an [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source open source] clone of the Microprose game [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Tycoon Transport Tycoon Deluxe (TTD)]. 

You play the role of president of a start-up transport company in 1950, building railway, road, air and naval transportation systems for commodities and people. The goal of the game is to outsmart your competition and become the game's highest-ranking transport company by the year 2050.

OpenTTD runs on Mac, Linux, Windows, Unix, BeOS, OS/2 and a few other [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Operating system|platforms]].

==Features==
While the game is modeled after the original by [http://www.chrissawyer.com/info.htm Chris Sawyer], OpenTTD has many additional features that enhance gameplay dramatically. OpenTTD has customizable game graphics, and work is underway to replace TTD's graphics completely. Many features were inspired by [http://www.ttdpatch.net/ TTDPatch], a popular enhancement for TTD, while other features are original.
