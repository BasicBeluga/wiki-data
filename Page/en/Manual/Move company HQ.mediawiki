[[Translation:en/Manual/Move company HQ]]
[[Category:en/Patch Settings]]

From your companies information screen, the same screen you use to build your companies HQ, you can now also move your HQ. After building your HQ a button will appear saying "Move HQ". If you click this you can just specify the new location of your HQ and your old one will be demolished. This does cost a little money however.
