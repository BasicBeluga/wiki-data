==Introduction==
OpenTTD has a brand new multiplayer system compared to [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/Transport Tycoon Deluxe]]. Servers can currently hold up to 8 companies (but work is in progress to push it up to at least 16), and by default up to 10 people can be connected to the server. There is no limit to the number of people that can play on a company, so you can either play head to head, or in [[en/Community/Play Style/Cooperative gameplay]] mode. At the moment you cannot play against the AI, but when the [[en/Archive/Development/New AI]] has been finished, you should be able to play against them.
