[[en/Manual/Main Page]] has a much better '''multiplayer''' system compared to the original [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport Tycoon Transport Tycoon Deluxe]. [[en/Manual/Server]]s can currently hold up to 15 companies, and up to 255 clients can be connected to the server. You can either play with your own company, or in [[en/Community/Play Style/Cooperative gameplay]] mode with another player.

As of OpenTTD 0.7.0 (or more precise since r15242) it is possible to move between companies/spectator and create new companies without having to rejoin the game

===New Company===
You can find the 'New Company' option in the company list, it is only available if you are a spectator. If the servers 'max_companies' limit has been reached, this option is grayed out

===Join Company===
Every company window has a join button (only displayed if you are not in that company).
[[File:en/Manual/Move company join.png|none|frame|company join button]]
A padlock displayed next to the join button indicates the company is password protected. Trying to join this company will prompt you for the password.

===Join Spectators===
If you are in a company and want to spectate for a little, or plan to start a new company and must join spectators first, the company list now shows the item 'Spectate' where the 'New Company' item was listed before.
If the servers 'max_spectators' limit has been reached, this option is grayed out.
