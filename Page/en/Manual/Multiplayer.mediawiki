OpenTTD has a much better multiplayer system compared to the original [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/Transport Tycoon Deluxe]]. [[en/Manual/Server]] can currently hold up to 8 companies, and up to 10 [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client (computing) clients] can be connected to the server. You can either play with your own company, or in [[en/Community/Play Style/Cooperative gameplay]] mode with another player.
