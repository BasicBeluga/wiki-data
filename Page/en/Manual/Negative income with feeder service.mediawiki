[[Translation:en/Manual/Negative income with feeder service]]
A common 'problem' is that vehicles of the last step get a negative income, sometimes a very huge amount.
This page explains why that happens.

Assume you have set up a feeder service like in the picture.
The service transports coal from the mine at station A at the bottom left, through an intermediate station B, to the power plant at the top right using station C. The first part of the journey is done with a train, the second part by road vehicles. But wait, the road vehicles get negative income! That can't be right.

Actually, it is correct, and the reason for this behaviour is fairly simple. The payment for all delivered cargo no matter how it gets to its destination is done by a fixed rule (see for all the detail on the [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#delivery-payment-rates|game mechanics]] page).
Basically,
* you get paid by the straight distance from source (the coal mine) to destination (the power plant), and
* you get fined for slower delivery from source to destination.

The game does not know where coal loaded into the train is going. When the train arrives at station B and transfers the coal, the game makes an estimate of how much you should get paid. It finds that 732 English pound is a fair amount, and assigns that to the train as virtual money.
Next, three road vehicles take the coal, and deliver it to the power plant at station C. Here, the game detects that the coal is being delivered to its final destination. It computes the exact payment (about 711 pound) for delivering the cargo from the coal mine directly to the power plant, deducts the already given 732 pounds, and comes up 21 pound short. As a result, each of the road vehicles has to pay 7 pound.
In other words, the vehicles get the bill for the (apparently) overestimated payment of the train.

==Predicting negative income==
The example is a pretty stupid way of delivering coal. It would have been much easier and faster to deliver the coal in a straight line by moving station B to the place of station C. This is usually a good indication of negative income. If your vehicles make a detour, that is going to cost money.

Another common case is the speed of delivery. The payment of the train is done with the same rules as the final payment. Since a train is much faster than a road vehicle, it gets less fine for slow delivery, that is, it gets more than it should given the average speed of the coal over the whole journey. The road vehicles also pay for their slow speed compared to the train.

Some tips to prevent negative income for your vehicles:
* Try to keep straight lines from the source to the destination. Not only is it faster, it also reduces the risk of vehicles for some part of the journey getting paid more than they should.
* Try to keep the speed of all parts of the journey as equal as possible. Slower vehicles pay the price for the overestimated payments of the other parts.
