[[Translation:en/Manual/New game]]
== Introduction ==

This is how you started your first game probably.
Anyways, this is the first button on the main menu.

When you press it, a new screen comes up with a 
whole bunch of options.

Now that you've gotten this far, here's what the options mean

== Options ==

The top row selects the [[en/Manual/Climates]] to use. From left to right there are Temperate, Sub-arctic, Sub-tropical and Toyland.

'''MAP SIZE'''
This is how big that map is. The smallest size is 64 tiles while the biggest is 2048.

'''NO. OF TOWNS'''
This is how many towns are on the map. It will depend on the size of the map. There is Very Low, Low, Normal, High, and Custom.

'''NO. OF INDUSTRIES'''
This is how many industries are on the map. It will also depend on the size of the map. There is None, Very Low, Low, Normal, and High.

'''DATE'''
This is the starting date where your game starts.

'''SNOW LINE HEIGHT'''
Only available with the Sub-Arctic Climate, this is how many tiles up before snow will stay there forever.

'''RANDOM SEED'''
This is the map the game plays on. Copy it and paste it if you want to play the same EXACT map (Town names are different however) over again or give to a friend.

'''LAND GENERATOR'''
This is the way the land is generated. I suggest you leave it where it is if already on TerraGenesis.

'''TREE ALGORITHM'''
This is how the trees are aligned. Keep it where it is, or it wont look good, unless you don't want any trees, which is 'None'.

'''TERRAIN TYPE'''
This is how flat or hilly the terrain is.

'''SEA LEVEL'''
This is how high the water goes up to.

'''SMOOTHNESS'''
This is how smooth the land is.

'''[[en/Manual/Variety distribution|VARIETY DISTRIBUTION]]''' 
Gives the option of more variability across the map

'''MAP EDGES'''
This is whether you want the map edges to be randomly generated or you manually generating them.

'''NORTHWEST/NORTHEAST/SOUTHWEST/SOUTHEAST'''
Whether this edge of the map is water or freeform (water and land)

== Ending ==

Now that you have set all your settings, press '''Generate''' to get started! Once the map has been created you will be taken to the [[en/Manual/Game interface]].
