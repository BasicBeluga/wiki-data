[[Translation:en/Manual/New game]]

== Introduction ==

This is how you started your first game probably.
Anyways, this is the first button on the main menu.

When you press it, a new screen comes up with a 
whole bunch of options.

Now that you've gotten this far, here's what the options mean

== Options ==

The top row selects the [[en/Manual/Climates]] to use. From left to right there are Temperate, Sub-arctic, Sub-tropical and Toyland.

'''MAP SIZE'''
This is how big that map is. The smallest size is 64 tiles while the biggest is 2048. For single player 512x512 will give you plenty of room.

'''NO. OF TOWNS'''
This is how many towns are on the map. It will depend on the size of the map. There is Very Low, Low, Normal, High, and Custom.

'''NO. OF INDUSTRIES'''
This is how many industries are on the map. It will also depend on the size of the map. There is None, Very Low, Low, Normal, and High. Lower values are more useful at larger maps, while higher values are more useful at smaller maps.
''None'' means 'start with zero industries' in OpenTTD version 1.0 or earlier, it means 'never build industries' in version 1.1 or later.

'''DATE'''
This is the starting date where your game starts. Default game starts at 1950.

'''SNOW LINE HEIGHT'''
Only available with the Sub-Arctic Climate, this is how many tiles up before snow will stay there forever.

'''RANDOM SEED'''
This is the map the game plays on. Copy it and paste it if you want to play the same map over again or give to a friend. However the other options in this window also apply and modify the result map. In order to recreate the exact same map you must also set the other options to the values they had when creating the original map. Town names will still be different.

'''LAND GENERATOR'''
This is the way the land is generated. I suggest you leave it where it is if already on TerraGenesis.

'''TREE ALGORITHM'''
This is how the trees are aligned. Keep it where it is, or it wont look good, unless you don't want any trees, which is 'None'.

'''TERRAIN TYPE'''
This is how flat or hilly the terrain is.

'''SEA LEVEL'''
A higher sea level will create a map with more sea and less land.

'''SMOOTHNESS'''
A smooth map has large fields of even land and slopes are mostly straight lines. A rough map has more changes in height levels and curved slopes.

'''[[en/Manual/Variety distribution|VARIETY DISTRIBUTION]]''' 
Gives the option of more variability across the map

'''MAP EDGES'''
This is whether you want the map edges to be randomly generated or you manually generating them.

'''NORTHWEST/NORTHEAST/SOUTHWEST/SOUTHEAST'''
Whether this edge of the map is water or freeform (water and land)

== Ending ==

Now that you have set all your settings, press '''Generate''' to get started! Once the map has been created you will be taken to the [[en/Manual/Game interface]].
