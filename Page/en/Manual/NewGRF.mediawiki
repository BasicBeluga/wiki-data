'''NewGRF''', or '''New Graphic Resource File''', is a term that loosely describes the practice of new features GRF files can exploit to change graphics and the behaviour of the game. One NewGRF file can change everything from graphics to train speed, name and design dates. This effectively means that with some NewGRF sets, you can have a game that starts in 1920 with rail vehicles right through to 2050. One of the most used graphic sets in use with OpenTTD is the [[en/Community/NewGRF/UK Renewal Set]] (UKRS), by [[en/Archive/Community/Users/PikkaBird]]. See the [[en/Community/NewGRF/Main Page]] for a comprehensive list of GRFs available.

==Usage==
# First you need to obtain the NewGRF file you want to use. See the [[en/Community/NewGRF/Main Page]]. Most files are issued with separate versions to account for the different color palettes in the DOS and Windows versions of TTD.  When offered the choice of DOS over Windows files, you need the Windows version.
# Copy the downloaded .grf file to the ''data'' directory of your OpenTTD installation. By default this will be <code>C:\Program Files\OpenTTD\data\</code> for Windows and <code>/usr/share/games/openttd/data/</code> for Linux (you will need root privileges to write to that directory). 
# Start OpenTTD.
# In the main menu, click the [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] button. (see the entry on NewGRF Settings for more details)
# Click the Add button.
# Choose the NewGRF files you want to use, and click the '''Add To Selection''' button.

Now, whenever you open a game, the changes in the NewGRF will become visible.

Any new games you begin will automatically use your newly installed .grf files.  Previously started games, however, require the following steps to include your new graphics:

# Open the OpenTTD console by hitting the ` key (key to the left of the "1" on most keyboards).
# Type in â€œresetengines
