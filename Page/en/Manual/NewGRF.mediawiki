NewGRF stands for New Graphics Resource File which provide a general interface to mod(ify) the game. As of OpenTTD 1.2.0, 32 bit graphics are also supplied via NewGRFs.

'''NewGRF''' is the way to add new or modify existing graphics, vehicles, buildings, cargos, railtypes, objects and industries within OpenTTD. NewGRF files may be downloaded and selected for activation prior to creation of a new game in order to introduce these features. Unlike [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings]] which may be changed part way through a game, NewGRF should be installed prior to starting a new game in order to ensure correct operation. The name "NewGRF" refers to the new features added to GRF files (Transport Tycoon graphics resource files) which can be exploited to change graphics and the behaviour of the game. NewGRF is a shared format between OpenTTD and [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]], and is almost fully compatible with both.

For common issues with GRF files in OpenTTD, visit the [[en/Archive/Community/NewGRF FAQ| NewGRF FAQ]].

==Getting NewGRFs==
=== Online content ===
The most common and convenient way to obtain NewGRFs is by using the ingame [[en/Manual/Online content|online content download]] feature. Most NewGRF can be found there. There exists also a NewGRF [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=26|development forum] where you may find development versions of some newgrfs.
=== Manual install ===
If you want to use NewGRFs obtained from other locations, which are not available from the online content download, you need to manually install them into the correct place. A NewGRF is a single file (with the extension .grf) for example: "grvts.grf". To install a NewGRF:
#Download the NewGRF (.grf) file.
#Move the NewGRF file to the data directory of your OpenTTD installation.
:*This will often be:
::C:\My Documents\data (Windows 95, 98, ME)
::C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\My Documents\OpenTTD\data (Windows 2000, XP)
::C:\Users\<username>\Documents\OpenTTD\data (Windows Vista, 7)
::~/.openttd/data (Linux, BSD)
::~/Documents/OpenTTD/data (OSX)

==Activating NewGRFs==
1.   In the main menu, click "NewGRF Settings".
[[File:en/Manual/Main window (NewGRF Settings).png|Main window (NewGRF Settings)|center]]

The interface changed between OpenTTD 1.0 and 1.1, thus both will be presented here after one another:

=== Version 1.1 and newer ===
2.   Select a NewGRF from the 'inactive NewGRFs files' and press "Add" or simply double click on it. On small screens it looks like
[[File:en/Manual/Newgrf addnew.png|NewGRF settings window (small)|center]]
and on big screens it more conveniently expands to:
[[File:en/Manual/Newgrf config big.png|NewGRF settings window (big)|center]]
3.   Configure an active newgrf's parameter, if needed: Select it from the 'active newgrf files' list and choose the 'parameter' button. The result may look similar to
[[File:en/Manual/Newgrf parameter.png|NewGRF parameter window|center]]
4.   Optionally you may choose to save the selection of newgrfs (along with their configuration parameters) or load such list by making use of the NewGRF presets:

=== Version 1.0 and earlier ===
2.   Click "Add".
[[File:en/Manual/NewGRF settings window (Add).png|NewGRF settings window (Add)|center]]
3.   Select the NewGRF file you want to use, then click "Add To Selection".
[[File:en/Manual/Available NewGRF files window.png|Available NewGRF files window|center]]
4.   Click "Add" to add more NewGRFs, then "Apply Changes" when you are done.

== 8 bit vs 32 bit graphics ==
{{en/Feature|1.2}}
As of OpenTTD 1.2.0, NewGRFs can contain not only the usual 8 bit graphics, but also 32 bit graphics. With this change, NewGRFs are in fact the only way to supply 32 bit graphics to OpenTTD 1.2.0 or newer. From this point forward, NewGRFs are also able to supply different graphics for the different zoom levels.

It is not possible to use 32 bit graphics in the old png/tar format with OpenTTD 1.2.0 and above. Not all previously exiting 32 bit graphics are already available in NewGRF format. See the [[en/Community/NewGRF/Playing with 32 bpp graphics]] for a list of 32 bit graphics available to OpenTTD 1.2.0 and newer.

If you wish to use the old 32 bit graphics format, then you have to use the Extra Zoom patched version of OpenTTD, which is no longer updated. See [[en/Community/NewGRF/Playing with 32 bpp graphics]] for details

==Closing remarks==
Now, whenever you start a new game, the choice of NewGRFs will become active, and whatever changes they make to the game will become effective. However changing these settings will have no effect on existing savegames as newgrfs are an integral part of a savegame and the list of used newgrfs is stored within it.

[[File:en/Manual/Newgrfexampless.png|thumb|600px|center|A screenshot showing use of newgrf files including UKRS and Newstations]]

The order of (active) NewGRFs is important in determining how different NewGRFs interact. A NewGRF lower in the list overrides the effects of a NewGRF further up in the list.
