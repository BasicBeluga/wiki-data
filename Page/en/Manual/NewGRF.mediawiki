'''NewGRF''', or '''New Graphic Resource File''', is a term that loosely describes the practice of new features GRF files can exploit to change graphics and the behaviour of the game. One NewGRF file can change everything from graphics to train speed, name and design dates. This effectively means that with some NewGRF sets, you can have a game that starts in 1920 with rail vehicles right through to 2050. One of the most used graphic sets in use with OpenTTD is the [[en/Community/NewGRF/UK Renewal Set]] (UKRS), by [[en/Archive/Community/Users/PikkaBird]]. See the [[en/Archive/Lists/NewGRF Sets]] for more large NewGRF sets.

== Usage ==

{{en/Note|In OpenTTD 0.5.0 and later you can use the [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] window to configure NewGRF files.}}
To use the newgrf sets you have to:

:1. Copy the new .grf file to the \data directory.
:2. Open the openttd.cfg file in the \ directory.
:3. Go to the end of the file and enter the following:

 [newgrf]
 firstset.grf
 secondset.grf
 thirdset.grf

Where firstset, secondset etc.. are the names of the .grf files of the set. The files are loaded in the specified order... so if the second set has some features that are also in the firstset, the features of the firstset would be overwritten.

Note that it is a good practice to put all the newgrf files to a directory such as \data\custom or \data\newgrf. It especially makes upgrading OpenTTD easier, as well as managing a large number of newgrf files.

Be careful when using subdirs of the data directory for storing custom newgrf files. You have to adjust the path in the openttd.cfg like \custom\newgrffile.grf if your "custom" folder is a subfolder of the OpenTTDs data folder.

Most files are issued with separate versions to account for the different palettes in the DOS and Windows versions of TTD.  When offered the choice of DOS of Windows files, you need the <!-- DOS --> Windows version.

== Multiple combinations ==
If you want to configure more than one combination of sets you can do this:

 [newgrf]
 #COMBINATION 1
 firstset.grf
 secondset.grf
 #COMBINATION 2
 #another_firstset.grf
 #another_secondset.grf

Now you can switch between the combinations by removing the "#" from before one combination and add it to the other combination.

Words after # are treated just like a comment - they are skipped.

 [newgrf]
 #
 #Trains
 #
 firstset.grf
 secondset.grf
 #
 #Newstations
 #
 #thirdset.grf - I turned it off because it's buggy
 fourthset.grf
 #
 #Ships
 #
 fifthset.grf

I'm testing some combinations like "DBset + Arcticset", "Temperateset + Tropicset" and so on... for the moment the only combination that works well is "Temperateset + Arcticset" (note that this information can be obsolete and may not reflect the current state of things; please refer to the Forums for the current status).

== Parameters ==

Some newgrf files accept one or more parameters. To add a parameter to a grf file, do something like:

 [newgrf]
 firstsetw.grf           # Doesn't require any parameters
 secondsetw.grf 5 3 1250 # Three parameters
 thirdsetw.grf=10        # Alternate form of providing parameters.
