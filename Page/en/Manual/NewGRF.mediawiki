NewGRF stands for New Graphics Resource File. There are two kinds of replacement graphics. One is the NewGRFs which are described here (and are way more powerful than just introducing more and new graphics), the other are the [[en/Community/NewGRF/Playing with 32 bpp graphics| 32bpp replacement graphics]] which just override existing 8bpp graphics with different graphics.

'''NewGRF''' is the way new graphics, vehicles, buildings, cargoes and industries can be introduced into OpenTTD. NewGRF files may be downloaded and installed into the game to introduce these new features. Unlike [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings]] which may be changed part way through a game, NewGRF should be installed prior to starting a new game in order to ensure correct operation. The name "NewGRF" refers to the new features added to GRF files (Transport Tycoon graphics files) which can be exploited to change graphics and the behaviour of the game. NewGRF is a shared format between OpenTTD and [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]], and is almost fully compatible with both.

For common issues with GRF files in OpenTTD, visit the [[en/Archive/Community/NewGRF FAQ| NewGRF FAQ]].

==Getting NewGRFs==
NewGRFs are community produced, and therefore may be downloaded from many websites. Some main places to look are:
*[http://www.tt-forums.net/index.php TTForums.net] (particularly the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=26 TTDPatch] and [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=36 OpenTTD] graphics boards) - The centre of discussion of most NewGRF development.
*[http://grfcrawler.tt-forums.net/ GRFCrawler] - A database of NewGRFs, linked with the TTForums.
*OpenTTD [[en/Community/NewGRF/Main Page]] - The OpenTTD wiki NewGRF list.
*[http://www.ttdpatch.net/newgrf.html TTDPatch NewGRF list] - The TTDPatch wiki NewGRF list.
There are also many private websites which host NewGRFs, including:
*[http://george.zernebok.net/newgrf/downloads.html George's website]
*[http://www.pikkarail.com/ttdp/ Pikkabird's website]
As of January 17th 2009 OpenTTD has an ingame feature for downloading game content such as NewGRF files:
* [[en/Manual/Online content|Downloading Online Content]] using the ingame feature. Please note that you need at least OpenTTD 0.7.0 Beta 1 to use this feature. '''This feature is not available in the 0.6.x series.'''

==Installing NewGRFs==
A NewGRF is a single file (with the extension .grf) for example: "grvts.grf". To install a NewGRF:
#Download the NewGRF (.grf) file.
#Move the NewGRF file to the data directory of your OpenTTD installation.
:*This will often be:
::"%UserProfile%\My documents\OpenTTD\Data" (Windows XP)
::"%UserProfile%\Documents\OpenTTD\Data" (Windows Vista)
::"C:/Program Files/OpenTTD/data" (Windows, game directory)
::"/usr/share/games/openttd/data/" (Linux) - root privileges necessary to write to this directory.
::"~/.openttd/data" (Linux) - you may need to create this directory first
::"~/Documents/OpenTTD/data" (OSX) - make directory /data

===Windows or DOS version?===
Often, you are given a choice between a Windows and a DOS version of a NewGRF. Which one you need, depends on the original graphic files. If the origin of the original graphic files is a DOS version of TTD, you need a DOS version of a NewGRF. Similar, if you have the Windows version TTD files, you need a Windows version of a NewGRF.


If you don't know which version (DOS or Windows) you own, there's an easy way to figure that out. First, locate the OpenTTD Data directory, in which the original graphic files are stored. The file names reveal everything:
* DOS version: trg1.grf, trgc.grf, trgh.grf, trgi.grf, trgt.grf
* Windows version:  trg1r.grf, trgcr.grf, trghr.grf, trgir.grf, trgtr.grf (notice the extra 'r' before '.grf'.)

[[en/Archive/Community/OpenGFX Readme]] uses windows palette only.

If the wrong type of NewGRF is installed it will work, but the graphics will not appear correctly.

==Activating NewGRFs==
1.   Start OpenTTD.

2.   In the main menu, click "[[en/Manual/NewGRF]]".
[[File:en/Manual/Main window (NewGRF Settings).png|Main window (NewGRF Settings)|center]]
3.   Click "Add".
[[File:en/Manual/NewGRF settings window (Add).png|NewGRF settings window (Add)|center]]
4.   Select the NewGRF file you want to use, then click "Add To Selection".
[[File:en/Manual/Available NewGRF files window.png|Available NewGRF files window|center]]
5.   Click "Add" to add more NewGRFs, then "Apply Changes" when you are done.
[[File:en/Manual/NewGRF settings window (Apply).png|NewGRF settings window (Apply)|center]]


Now, whenever you start a new game, the NewGRFs will be active, and whatever changes they make will become visible.

===The other buttons===
'''NewGRF Settings window'''
*Add - Opens the Available NewGRF files window.
*Remove - Removes the selected NewGRF from the list of active NewGRFs.
*Move Up - Moves the selected GRF up in the order of active NewGRFs.
*Move Down - Moves the selected GRF down in the order of active NewGRFs.
*Set parameters - Sets NewGRF parameters, for example to set parameter 1 to 4, parameter 2 to 3 and parameter 3 to zero enter "4 3 0".
*Apply changes - Applies changes and exits the window.

The order of NewGRFs is important in determining how different NewGRFs interact. A NewGRF higher in the list overrides the effects of a NewGRF lower in the list.

'''Available NewGRF files window'''
*Add to selection - Adds the selected NewGRF to the list of active NewGRFs.
*Rescan files - OpenTTD only looks for NewGRF files when the game starts, this makes the game rescan the folder to check for new files.

===Activating NewGRFs in-game===
{{en/Warning|This procedure is NOT recommended and may result in unexpected behaviour or even crashes.}}

While new games will automatically use your newly installed .grf files, previously started games require the following steps to include your new graphics:

# Go to Game options>NewGRF settings.
# Add the desired NewGRFs.
# Confirm to make these changes in-game. Mind the possible consequences, make a backup savegame before.
# Open the OpenTTD console with the key to the left of the "1", the ` key on many keyboard layouts
# Type in "resetengines".
# Close the console by pressing the same key as you used to open it.

Note that even after typing â€œresetengines", your pre-existing vehicles will still be of the old type.  However, you should now be able to build the new types of vehicles from any of your depots.

==Configuration File==
An alternative way of specifying which NewGRF files to use is by directly altering the openttd.cfg configuration file. The steps to do this are as follows:
# Copy the new .grf file to the \data directory.
# Open the openttd.cfg file in the \ directory.
# Go to the end of the file and enter the following:

 [newgrf]
 firstset.grf
 secondset.grf
 thirdset.grf

Where firstset, secondset etc.. are the names of the .grf files of the set. The files are loaded in the specified order... so if secondset has some features that are also in firstset, the features of the first set would be overwritten.

Note that it is a good practice to put all the newgrf files to a directory such as \data\custom or \data\newgrf. It especially makes upgrading OpenTTD easier, as well as managing a large number of newgrf files.

Be careful when using subdirs of the data directory for storing custom newgrf files. You have to adjust the path in the openttd.cfg like \custom\newgrffile.grf if your "custom" folder is a subfolder of the OpenTTDs data folder.

=== Multiple combinations ===
If you want to configure more than one combination of sets you can do this:

 [newgrf]
 #COMBINATION 1
 firstset.grf
 secondset.grf
 #COMBINATION 2
 #another_firstset.grf
 #another_secondset.grf

Now you can switch between the combinations by removing the "#" from before one combination and add it to the other combination.

Words after # are treated just like a comment - they are skipped.

 [newgrf]
 #
 #Trains
 #
 firstset.grf
 secondset.grf
 #
 #Newstations
 #
 #thirdset.grf - I turned it off because it's buggy
 fourthset.grf
 #
 #Ships
 #
 fifthset.grf

I'm testing some combinations like "DBset + Arcticset", "Temperateset + Tropicset" and so on... for the moment the only combination that works well is "Temperateset + Arcticset" (note that this information can be obsolete and may not reflect the current state of things; please refer to the Forums for the current status).

===Parameters===

Some NewGRF files accept one or more parameters. See the [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] article for information on adding parameters to a GRF file, or do the following in your openttd.cfg file:

 [newgrf]
 firstsetw.grf           # Doesn't require any parameters
 secondsetw.grf 5 3 1250 # Three parameters
 thirdsetw.grf=10        # Alternate form of providing parameters.

Note: As you can see, multiple NewGRF parameters are separated by spaces.

== NewGRF Compatibility and Features ==
NewGRF is originally a [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]] feature, and as such, the latest NewGRF features are not always available in OpenTTD.

What has to be done/is done next can be found in the [[en/NewGRF TODO]]. What has been done is in the [[en/NewGRF Features]] list..
