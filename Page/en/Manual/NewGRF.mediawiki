'''NewGRF''', or '''New Graphic Resource File''', is a term that loosely describes the practice of new features GRF files can exploit to change graphics and the behaviour of the game. One NewGRF file can change everything from graphics to train speed, name and design dates. This effectively means that with some NewGRF sets, you can have a game that starts in 1920 with rail vehicles right through to 2050. One of the most used graphic sets in use with OpenTTD is the [[en/Community/NewGRF/UK Renewal Set]] (UKRS), by [[en/Archive/Community/Users/PikkaBird]]. See the [[en/Community/NewGRF/Main Page]] for a comprehensive list of GRFs available.

==Getting NewGRFs==
NewGRFs are community produced, and therefore may be downloaded from many websites. Some main places to look are:
*[http://www.tt-forums.net/index.php TTForums.net] (particularly the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=26 TTDPatch] and [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=36 OpenTTD] graphics boards) - The centre of discussion of most NewGRF development.
*[http://grfcrawler.tt-forums.net/ GRFCrawler] - A database of NewGRFs, linked with the TTForums.
*OpenTTD [[en/Community/NewGRF/Main Page]] - The OpenTTD wiki NewGRF list.
*[http://www.ttdpatch.net/newgrf.html TTDPatch NewGRF list] - The TTDPatch wiki NewGRF list.
There are also many private websites which host NewGRFs, including:

==Installing NewGRFs==
A NewGRF is a single file (with the extension .grf) for example: "grvts.grf". To install a NewGRF:
#Download the NewGRF (.grf) file.
#Move the NewGRF file to the data directory of your OpenTTD installation.
:*This will often be:
::"C:/Program Files/OpenTTD/data" (Windows)
::"/usr/share/games/openttd/data/" (Linux) - root privileges necessary to write to this directory.

If given a choice between the Windows or DOS version of a NewGRF you will want the Windows version. If the wrong type is installed it will work, but the graphics will not appear correctly.

==Activating NewGRFs==
# Start OpenTTD.
# In the main menu, click the [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] button. (see the entry on NewGRF Settings for more details)
# Click the Add button.
# Choose the NewGRF files you want to use, and click the '''Add To Selection''' button.

Now, whenever you open a game, the changes in the NewGRF will become visible.

Any new games you begin will automatically use your newly installed .grf files.  Previously started games, however, require the following steps to include your new graphics:

# Open the OpenTTD console by hitting the ` key (key to the left of the "1" on most keyboards).
# Type in â€œresetengines
