<warning>Note: newgrf syntax has changed in revision 1157. This document refers to the most recent syntax</warning>

== Usage ==
To use the newgrf sets you have to:

:1. Open the openttd.cfg file.
:2. Go to the end of the file and enter the following:

<code>[newgrf]<br>
firstset.grf<br>
secondset.grf<br>
thirdset.grf</code>

Where firstset, secondset etc.. are the names of the .grf files of the set. The files are loaded in the specified order... so if the second set has some features that are also in the firstset, the features of the firstset would be overwritten.

== Multiple combinations ==
If you want to configure more than one combination of sets you can do this:

<code>[newgrf]</code><br>
<code>#COMBINATION 1</code><br>
<code>firstset.grf</code><br>
<code>secondset.grf</code><br>
<code>#COMBINATION 2</code><br>
<code>#another_firstset.grf</code><br>
<code>#another_secondset.grf</code>

Now you can switch between the combinations by removing the "#" from before one combination number and add it to the other combination, don't try to activate both combinations because some errors can happen.

Another thing to remember is to not put gaps between numbers, such as:

<code>[newgrf]</code><br>
<code>firstset.grf</code><br>
<code>secondset.grf</code><br>
<code>#thirdset.grf</code><br>
<code>fourthset.grf</code><br>
<code>fifthset.grf</code>

In this case, the game loads only "firstset.grf" and "secondset.grf", "thirdset.grf" is deactivated and the game think that there aren't other sets to load.

I'm testing some combinations like "DBset + Arcticset", "Temperateset + Tropicset" and so on... for the moment the only combination that works well is "Temperateset + Arcticset"

== Default configuration ==

<code>[newgrf]</code><br>
<code>#DEFAULT</code><br>
<code>tempsetw.grf</code><br>
<code>arcticsetw.grf</code><br>
<code>newshipsw.grf</code><br>
<code>#3cargosetw.grf</code>
