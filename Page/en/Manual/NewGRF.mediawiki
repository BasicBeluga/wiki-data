Hi all,I would like to contribute my cnaoolidsted.db. Of course I already installed the iOS-Update, so I can no longer extract it from the default backup location.Instead I would like to extract cnaoolidsted.db's from my TimeMachine backups. I also think that this would be an easy way to still get db's even from people who already updated.I could imagine some kind of  Choose backup location -button or something similar. It would be great if someone could add this to the applet. I actually found the right line in the source, change it to a static TM location, but then failed to compile due to lack of experience with java  Thanks in advanceljr
