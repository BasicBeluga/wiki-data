[[Translation:en/Manual/Orders]]
{{en/Manual/Navigation}}


Eventually you get tired of looking at the decade-old graphics and the AI doing all the playing and you would like some action yourself. For that you need to purchase [[en/Manual/Vehicles]]. Once that is done and you have found a suitable [[en/Destination]] that will make a lot of profit, you will need to give out '''orders''' to your vehicles to set them on their way.

==How do I give out orders?==
First of all you find and click on the just purchased vehicle, or of course an existing one if you want to change its orders. Now click on the straight arrow, encircled in red (Fig 1). You can see that the vehicle currently has no orders (Fig 2). We will now connect the 2 bus stations Corocoro Central and Corocoro with a passenger line. Click on ''Go To'' then click on ''Corocoro Central'' bus [[en/Manual/Stations]]. You will see that ''Corocoro Central'' is added to the orders list. Now click on ''Go To'' again and then click on ''Corocoro'' (it doesn't matter if you click on the bus or the train station, they are connected and therefore act as one station). It is helpful to remember that when giving orders, the new order will be placed at the end of the list or above the currently highlighted order.

You will see that both stations are added to the orders list of the bus. If you now [[en/Start vehicle|start]] (status bar or [[en/Red flag]] in [[en/Manual/Depots|depot]]) the bus it will run a regular service between these two stations.

==What are possible targets for orders?==
*Your own stations, but only stations where that particular vehicle is accepted. So you cannot give a bus an order to go to an airport if that airport doesn't have a bus station. You cannot send your vehicles to competitor's stations.
*[[en/Manual/Depots]] if the "''Allow goto depot orders''" is set in the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Vehicles|configure patches -> vehicles]] window.
*Vehicles of the same type to [[en/Manual/Orders]] or to create [[en/Manual/Orders]]. See below for more information.
*[[en/Manual/Waypoints]], you can send a train to a particular waypoint to influence its choice of track or if the stations are too far apart and the train gets lost easily.

==It works! But where is my vehicle heading now?==
You can always see the vehicle's destination in its [[en/Manual/Status bar]]. Also, in the ''Orders'' window, just before the numbers showing the indexes of the orders, you can see a black triangle pointing to one of those. That is the current destination.

==What do all those other buttons do?==

When you first open the ''Orders'' window, only ''Go To'' is active, or also ''Skip'' if there are already existing orders; all others are disabled. Only after clicking on one of the orders in the list do the other buttons become active. Almost all types of vehicles in the game have the same buttons at the bottom of the ''Orders'' window, except for trains, which also have a ''Non Stop'' button. To add one of the modifiers to an order (Non-Stop, Full Load, Unload), click on that order, and then on the modifier. You will see that the order will change, showing the changes you have made.

===Skip===
This will cause the train to skip the order it's currently fulfilling and move onto the next one.  For example, in the scenario in the image below, clicking ''Skip'' when the vehicle is going to ''Corocoro Central'' will have our trusty bus turn around at a convenient place and head for ''Corocoro''. Pressing ''Skip'' on the last order will rewind the target back to the first one.

===Delete===
Will delete the highlighted order from the vehicle's list, effectively cancelling your service to that station with that vehicle.

===Non-Stop===
This is an option for trains only, and only for an existing order.  It will prevent a train stopping at any of the stations it passes through on the way to the highlighted destination.

===Go To===
This is the way to direct a vehicle to a particular station.  It inserts a new order before the highlighted order, or if there is no order selected, adds it to theend of list.

See the ''[[#how-do-i-give-out-orders|How do I give out orders?]]'' section above for more information.

===Full Load===
This will ensure that the vehicle waits until it has a full load of any cargo before leaving the station.  There is a patch that orders the vehicle to wait until the train is fully loaded with ''all'' the cargos it can carry.

===Unload===
This instructs the vehicle to leave any cargo it is carrying at a station.  Any cargo accepted by that station will be handled as usual, i.e. you will be paid.  Any cargo not accepted by the station will be unloaded anyway and left for another vehicle to pick up.  That train will not receive a payment for any cargo that is not accepted.

This option also prevents the train from picking up any new cargo at that station.

===Transfer===
This option will have the train unload its cargo to a station regardless of acceptance, just as Unload does.  However in this case you will receive part payment for the distance it has travelled so far.  This is useful to run a feeder service without your vehicles showing a negative profit if they are not running the final part of the journey.  The cargo will wait in the station showing ''"En route from (source)"'' in the Waiting screen.

By default the vehicle will also collect any waiting cargo as usual.  Confusingly this can include the cargo you just dropped off!  If this is the active setting, the order will show ''Transfer and take cargo''.  If this is not what you want, you can click the ''Unload'' order as well which will toggle the order to ''Transfer and leave empty'', preventing the vehicle picking up any cargo there.

===Shared Orders===
The [[File:en/Manual/SharedOrders.png]] icon to the right of the Transfer button is the Shared Orders button. It shows a list of all the vehicles that have the same [[en/Manual/Orders]] as the current vehicle. The icon will only be enabled if the vehicle is sharing orders.

==Timetable==
{{en/Nightly}}
Timetables are currently a [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build|nightly only]] feature within OpenTTD which creates a new level of giving orders. The timetable button is located on the right top of the orders window. All orders for the selected vehicle are displayed inside the Timetable window. You can choose how much time a train should wait in a station (in days or cycles - configure via patches) and if you wish, how much time it should take the train to travel between points of its route. There is a counter stating whether a train is on time or whether  a delay has occurred.

==Copying vehicle orders==
If you have multiple vehicles doing the same route, you can [[en/Manual/Orders]] or better yet, use [[en/Manual/Orders]].

==What happens if things go funny?==
In a large network, it can happen that the schedule of a vehicle has invalid or entries that make no sense. To remedy this, an 
[[en/Manual/Orders]] has been implemented.
