[[Translation:en/Manual/Orders]]
{{en/Manual/Navigation}}
Eventually you get tired of looking at the decade-old graphics and the AI doing all the playing and you would like some action yourself. For that you need to purchase [[en/Manual/Vehicles]]. Once that is done and you have found a suitable [[en/Destination]] that will make a lot of profit, you will need to give out orders to your vehicles to set them on their way.

==How do I give out orders?==
First of all you find and click on the just purchased vehicle, or of course an existing one if you want to change its orders. Now click on the straight arrow, encircled in red (Fig 1). You can see that the vehicle currently has no orders (Fig 2). We will now connect the 2 bus stations Corocoro Central and Corocoro with a passenger line. Click on ''Go To'' then click on ''Corocoro Central'' bus [[en/Manual/Stations]]. You will see that ''Corocoro Central'' is added to the orders list. Now click on ''Go To'' again and then click on ''Corocoro'' (it doesn't matter if you click on the bus or the train station, they are connected and therefore act as one station). It is helpful to remember that when giving orders, the new order will be placed at the end of the list or above the currently highlighted order.

You will see that both stations are added to the orders list of the bus. If you now [[en/Start vehicle|start]] (status bar or [[en/Red flag]] in [[en/Manual/Depots|depot]]) the bus it will run a regular service between these two stations.

==What are possible targets for orders?==
*Your own stations, but only stations where that particular vehicle is accepted. So you cannot give a bus an order to go to an airport if that airport doesn't have a bus station. You cannot send your vehicles to competitor's stations.
*[[en/Manual/Depots]] if the "''Allow goto depot orders''" is set in the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Vehicles|configure patches -> vehicles]] window.
*Vehicles of the same type to [[en/Manual/Orders]] or to create [[en/Manual/Orders]]. See below for more information.
*[[en/Manual/Waypoints]], you can send a train to a particular waypoint to influence it's choice of track or if the stations are too far apart and the train gets lost easily.

==It works! But where is my vehicle heading now?==
You can always see the vehicle's destination in its [[en/Manual/Status bar]]. Also, in the ''Orders'' window, just before the numbers showing the indexes of the orders, you can see a black triangle pointing to one of those. That is the current destination.

==What do all those other buttons do?==

{{en/Outdated}}

When you first open the ''Orders'' window, only ''Go To'' is active, or also ''Skip'' if there are already existing orders; all others are disabled. Only after clicking on one of the orders in the list, do the other buttons become active. Almost all types of vehicles in the game have the same buttons at the bottom of the ''Orders'' window, except for trains, which also have a ''Non Stop'' button. To add one of the modifiers to an order (Non-Stop, Full Load, Unload), click on that order, and then on the modifier. You will see that the order will change, showing the changes you have made.

{|
| '''''Skip'''''||Will make the vehicle skip its current order and jump to the next one. Pressing ''Skip'' when the vehicle is going to ''Corocoro Central'' will have our trusty bus turn around pretty soon and head for ''Corocoro''. Pressing ''Skip'' on the last order will rewind the target back to the first one.
|-
| '''''Delete'''''||Will delete that order from the vehicle's list, effectively cancelling your service to that station with that vehicle.
|-
| '''''[[en/Archive/Manual/Non-stop]]'''''||Only applies to trains. There is a switch in the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Stations|configure patches -> station]] window that lets you toggle the behaviour of this switch.
|-
| '''''[[en/Full Load]]'''''||Will have that vehicle stay at the station on arrival and wait until it is fully loaded with its [[en/Manual/Cargo]]. Setting this modifier can make your vehicles stay at that station for a very long time, so beware! There is also a switch in the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Stations|configure patches -> station]] window that lets you toggle the behaviour of this switch.
|-
| '''''[[en/Manual/Orders]]'''''||Will force a vehicle to leave that particular station empty. Should the cargo be [[en/Accepted]], it will be delivered to the nearby industry or town and you will get paid. Should it be not accepted, the cargo will remain at the station to be transported somewhere else. This is handy for [[en/Manual/Feeder service]]s for example.

==I am too lazy. Can you make my life easier?==
If you have multiple vehicles doing the same route, for example many trains hauling wood from a massive forest, you might get tired of giving out the same orders over and over again to a dozen or so trains. Changing all these orders is even worse. But you are in luck. Just as with [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]], it is also possible to [[en/Manual/Orders]], and to create [[en/Manual/Orders]].

==What happens if things go funny?==
In a large network, it can happen that the schedule of a vehicle has invalid or entries that make no sense. To remedy this, an 
[[en/Manual/Orders]] has been implemented.
