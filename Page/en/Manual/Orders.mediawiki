[[Translation:en/Manual/Orders]]
{{en/Manual/Navigation}}
'''Orders''' are fundamental to playing OpenTTD successfully.  If you do not issue any orders, your [[en/Manual/Vehicles]] will drive around aimlessly and you will be very lucky if they make you any money.  In order to successfully pick up and deliver [[en/Manual/Cargo]] (which is after all the object of the game), you need to issue your vehicles orders.  These will be instructions such as "go here, pick up this cargo, then take it here" although there is a great deal more flexibility than that available.

==Giving Orders==
Naturally, being its owner, you are allowed to give orders to any vehicle you own.  Your drivers will try to follow these without question (although they may get lost if your network is poorly designed, but that's a separate issue). To give orders:
[[File:en/Manual/Orders-1.png|frame|The vehicle window]]
[[File:en/Manual/Orders-2.png|frame|The orders window]]
#First find and click on vehicle you want to give the order to.  This may be in a depot if you have just bought it or it may be an existing vehicle that's already on the move. For a train, clicking any carriage will have the same effect.  This will display the vehicle window:
#Next click on the ''Orders'' button (circled in red in the screenshot). This will display the orders window, which displays any orders the vehicle currently has (you can see our example vehicle doesn't have any).
#The fundamental type of order is [[#go-to|Go To]] - this simply instructs the vehicle to go to a station, where it will drop off any cargo it is carrying and pick up anything that's waiting (if the cargo is of the correct type for the vehicle and station).  This is the only type of order that can create a new entry in the list.  To instruct a vehicle to go to a station, click ''Go To'' and then click the target station on the map.
#Orders in the list can be selected.  Selecting an order allows you to specify various options on it.  It also causes any ''Go To'' orders you then issue to be inserted before the selected order.

==What are possible targets for orders?==
*Your own stations, but only stations where that particular vehicle is accepted. So you cannot give a bus an order to go to an airport if that airport doesn't have a bus station. You cannot send your vehicles to competitor's stations.
*[[en/Manual/Depots]] if the "''Allow goto depot orders''" is set in the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches/Vehicles|configure patches -> vehicles]] window.
*Vehicles of the same type to [[en/Manual/Orders]] or to create [[en/Manual/Orders]]. See below for more information.
*[[en/Manual/Waypoints]], you can send a train to a particular waypoint to influence its choice of track or if the stations are too far apart and the train gets lost easily.

==It works! But where is my vehicle heading now?==
You can always see the vehicle's destination in its [[en/Manual/Status bar]]. Also, in the ''Orders'' window, just before the numbers showing the indexes of the orders, you can see a black triangle pointing to one of those. That is the current destination.

==What do all those other buttons do?==

When you first open the ''Orders'' window, only ''Go To'' is active, or also ''Skip'' if there are already existing orders; all others are disabled. Only after clicking on one of the orders in the list do the other buttons become active. Almost all types of vehicles in the game have the same buttons at the bottom of the ''Orders'' window, except for trains, which also have a ''Non Stop'' button. To add one of the modifiers to an order (Non-Stop, Full Load, Unload), click on that order, and then on the modifier. You will see that the order will change, showing the changes you have made.

===Skip===
This will cause the train to skip the order it's currently fulfilling and move onto the next one.  For example, in the scenario in the image below, clicking ''Skip'' when the vehicle is going to ''Corocoro Central'' will have our trusty bus turn around at a convenient place and head for ''Corocoro''. Pressing ''Skip'' on the last order will rewind the target back to the first one.

===Delete===
Will delete the highlighted order from the vehicle's list, effectively cancelling your service to that station with that vehicle.

===Non-Stop===
This is an option for trains only, and only for an existing order.  It will prevent a train stopping at any of the stations it passes through on the way to the highlighted destination.

===Go To===
This is the way to direct a vehicle to a particular station.  It inserts a new order before the highlighted order, or if there is no order selected, adds it to theend of list.

See the ''[[#how-do-i-give-out-orders|How do I give out orders?]]'' section above for more information.

===Full Load===
This will ensure that the vehicle waits until it has a full load of any cargo before leaving the station.  There is a patch that orders the vehicle to wait until the train is fully loaded with ''all'' the cargos it can carry.

===Unload===
This instructs the vehicle to leave any cargo it is carrying at a station.  Any cargo accepted by that station will be handled as usual, i.e. you will be paid.  Any cargo not accepted by the station will be unloaded anyway and left for another vehicle to pick up.  That train will not receive a payment for any cargo that is not accepted.

This option also prevents the train from picking up any new cargo at that station.

===Transfer===
This option will have the train unload its cargo to a station regardless of acceptance, just as Unload does.  However in this case you will receive part payment for the distance it has travelled so far.  This is useful to run a feeder service without your vehicles showing a negative profit if they are not running the final part of the journey.  The cargo will wait in the station showing ''"En route from (source)"'' in the Waiting screen.

By default the vehicle will also collect any waiting cargo as usual.  Confusingly this can include the cargo you just dropped off!  If this is the active setting, the order will show ''Transfer and take cargo''.  If this is not what you want, you can click the ''Unload'' order as well which will toggle the order to ''Transfer and leave empty'', preventing the vehicle picking up any cargo there.

===Shared Orders===
The [[File:en/Manual/SharedOrders.png]] icon to the right of the Transfer button is the Shared Orders button. It shows a list of all the vehicles that have the same [[en/Manual/Orders]] as the current vehicle. The icon will only be enabled if the vehicle is sharing orders.

==Timetable==
{{en/Nightly}}
Timetables are currently a [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build|nightly only]] feature within OpenTTD which creates a new level of giving orders. The timetable button is located on the right top of the orders window. All orders for the selected vehicle are displayed inside the Timetable window. You can choose how much time a train should wait in a station (in days or cycles - configure via patches) and if you wish, how much time it should take the train to travel between points of its route. There is a counter stating whether a train is on time or whether  a delay has occurred.

[[File:en/Manual/Orders-timetable.png|none|frame|That's how it looks.]]

|<small>Changes time period assigned to line in timetable.</small>

|Late counter will became 0, thus showing the train is travelling on time.
|}

==Copying vehicle orders==
If you have multiple vehicles doing the same route, you can [[en/Manual/Orders]] or better yet, use [[en/Manual/Orders]].

==What happens if things go funny?==
In a large network, it can happen that the schedule of a vehicle has invalid or entries that make no sense. To remedy this, an 
[[en/Manual/Orders]] has been implemented.
