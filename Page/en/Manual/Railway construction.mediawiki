==Constructing Railways==
First of all, find two industries you can build a train line between. Eg, a coal mine and a power station. You can start construction by pressing the railway build button [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] on the [[en/Manual/Game interface|menu bar]]. Once clicked the Railway Construction window pops up (Fig 1).

==What do all those buttons do?==
From left to right:
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build rail.png]] '''Build Railways buttons''' (shortcut 1-4): [[en/Manual/Building tracks|Builds track]] in the selected direction, you can click and drag for non-diagonal tracks. It is more expensive to build track on farm land.
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build autorail.png]] '''[[en/Archive/Manual/Autorail]] button''': (shortcut A or 5) Click and drag, can also be used to build diagonal tracks (probably needs a better explanation->[[en/Archive/Manual/Autorail]]).
:*[[File:en/Manual/Clear title.png]] '''[[en/Manual/Landscaping|Clear land]] button''' (shortcut 6):Use the dynamite to clear squares of either your own track you've built wrong, or anything that's in your way. Don't demolish too many houses or buildings in a town because your company rating at that town will drop and they won't let you build any stations in their town.
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build traindepot.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Depots|depot]] button''' (shortcut 7): Opens the depot build window for you to select a depot direction to build. The Button will build a depot, for making and servicing vehicles. If you build a depot next to your own track, it will automatically build some track to connect it to your track. Take care to choose the depot facing the way you want it.
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build waypoint.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Waypoints|waypoint]] button''' (shortcut 8): Allows you to build a [[en/Manual/Waypoints]] on/over a rail track.
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build station.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Stations|station]] button''' (shortcut 9): Opens the station build window for you to select a station size and direction to build.
:*[[File:en/Manual/Place signal.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Signals|signal]] button''' (shortcut S):
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build bridge.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Bridges|bridge]] button''' (shortcut B):
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build traintunnel.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Tunnels|tunnel]] button''' (shortcut T): Use this tool to build [[en/Manual/Tunnels|tunnels]]. [[en/Manual/Tunnels]] usually work out cheaper than [[en/Manual/Bridges|bridges]] if possible. They also slow [[en/Manual/Trains|trains]] down less.
:*[[File:en/Manual/Toggle clear active.png]] '''Toggle clear button''' (shortcut R): When you select another tool and this you can remove that item, for example you can remove signals from a rail and leave the rail intact.
:*[[File:en/Manual/Convert rail.png]] '''[[en/Manual/Convert rail]] button''' (shortcut C): Converts Rails from one type to another (rail -> monorail -> maglev)
:*[[File:en/Manual/Manual html m233f8633.png]] '''Opens [[en/Manual/Landscaping|landscape]] toolbar''' (shortcut L): You'll need this if you need to change the shape of some land to allow your [[en/Manual/Vehicles|vehicles]] to pass through.

This is in the intergated build and may be in the LATEST nightly.
Several versions have been in the intergated but i`m just covering the latest one. It can also be used to do some other things.

==Types of Railway==
In the game there are currently three types of railways: 
:* Normal railways - available from the beginning of the game. Both steam and electric trains run on these railways.
:* Monorail - first available around 1999. Only trains built in a Monorail Depot will run on these rails.
:* Maglev - the fastest of the three types of railway, first available around 2020
In order to access the toolbars for Monorail and Maglev, click and hold on the Railway button, hover over the rail type you want and release.

==Differences to [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]]==
===Version 0.4.7 and before===
The monorails and maglevs are not merged and there are no electric railways (electric trains just run on normal railways) as in [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]], where Monorail or Maglev can be sacrificed for a special electric track.

===Nightly Build r4152 and after it===
There are now four types of railways.
