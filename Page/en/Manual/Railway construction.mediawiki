==Types of railway==
In the game there are currently three types of railways: 
:* Normal railways - available from the beginning of the game. 
:* Monorail - first available around 1999
:* Maglev - the fastest of the three types of railway, first available around 2020
A train will only work on one type of track.

==Differences to [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]]==
The monorails and maglevs are not merged and there are no electric railways (electric trains just run on normal railways) as in [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]].
