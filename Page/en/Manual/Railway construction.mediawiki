==Constructing Railways==
First of all, find two industries you can build a train line between. Eg, a coal mine and a power station. You can start construction by pressing the railway build button [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] on the [[en/Manual/Game interface|menu bar]]. Once clicked the Railway Construction window pops up (Fig 1).

==Types of Railway==
In the game there are currently three types of railways: 
:* Normal railways - available from the beginning of the game. Both steam and electric trains run on these railways.
:* Monorail - first available around 1999. Only trains built in a Monorail Depot will run on these rails.
:* Maglev - the fastest of the three types of railway, first available around 2020
In order to access the toolbars for Monorail and Maglev, click and hold on the Railway button, hover over the rail type you want and release.

==Differences to [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]]==
The monorails and maglevs are not merged and there are no electric railways (electric trains just run on normal railways) as in [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]].
