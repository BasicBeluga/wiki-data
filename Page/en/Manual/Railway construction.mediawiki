Railways and trains are probably the most fun vehicle to use in the game.  Trains are currently the most profitable vehicle.  You can build complex rail networks to handle hundreds of trains, and fully control where trains go by using [[en/Manual/Signals]] and [[en/Manual/Waypoints]].

==Railway construction toolbar==
Click the railway build button [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] on the [[en/Manual/Game interface#the-menu-bar|menu bar]] to display the railway construction toolbar.
[[File:en/Manual/Railroad Construction.png|none|frame|The railway construction toolbar]]
From left to right:
*[[File:en/Manual/Build rail.png]] '''Build Railways buttons''' (shortcut 1-4): [[en/Manual/Building tracks|Builds track]] in the selected direction, you can click and drag for non-diagonal tracks.
*[[File:en/Manual/Build autorail.png]] '''[[en/Archive/Manual/Autorail]] button''': (shortcut A or 5) Build track in any direction. Difficult to use at first. Use Ctrl to remove track.
*[[File:en/Manual/Clear title.png]] '''[[en/Manual/Landscaping|Clear land]] button''' (shortcut 6):Use the dynamite to clear squares of either your own track you've built wrong, or anything that's in your way.
*[[File:en/Manual/Build traindepot.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Depots|depot]] button''' (shortcut 7): Opens the depot build window for you to select a depot direction to build. The Button will build a depot, for making and servicing vehicles. If you build a depot next to your own track, it will automatically build some track to connect it to your track. Take care to choose the depot facing the way you want it.
*[[File:en/Manual/Build waypoint.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Waypoints|waypoint]] button''' (shortcut 8): Allows you to build a [[en/Manual/Waypoints]] on/over a rail track.
*[[File:en/Manual/Build station.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Stations|station]] button''' (shortcut 9): Opens the station build window for you to select a station size and direction to build.
*[[File:en/Manual/Place signal.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Signals|signal]] button''' (shortcut S)
*[[File:en/Manual/Build bridge.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Bridges|bridge]] button''' (shortcut B)
*[[File:en/Manual/Build traintunnel.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Tunnels|tunnel]] button''' (shortcut T) 
*[[File:en/Manual/Toggle clear active.png]] '''Toggle clear button''' (shortcut R): Click this after you have selected another tool to remove that item. For example you can remove signals from a rail and leave the rail intact.
*[[File:en/Manual/Convert rail.png]] '''[[en/Manual/Convert rail]] button''' (shortcut C): Converts Rails from one type to the currently selected type.
*[[File:en/Manual/Manual html m233f8633.png]] '''Opens [[en/Manual/Landscaping|landscape]] toolbar''' (shortcut L): Use this to change the shape of the land to allow construction.

===Types of railways===
To select which type of railway to build, click and hold the railway build button in the main menu.
[[File:en/Manual/Openttd-rail1.png|none|frame|Choose rail type]]
* [[en/Manual/Base Set/Railways]] - The only railway available at the start of the game. Only steam and diesel trains run on this railway.
* [[en/Manual/Base Set/Electrified railways]] - Available in 1965, when electric trains arrive. Steam, diesel and electric trains can still run on this railway.
* [[en/Manual/Base Set/Monorail]] - Available in 1999. Only trains built in a monorail depot can run on this railway.
* [[en/Manual/Base Set/MagLev]] - Available in 2022. Only Maglev trains can run on this railway.

==Building trains==
*To build a [[en/Manual/Trains]], place a train [[en/Manual/Depots]] and then click it. You will be presented with the depot window. 
*Click "Build new vehicles". A new window will pop up with a list of trains to purchase. 
*Select an engine and click "Buy vehicle" at the bottom of the window. The train will then appear in one of the slots in the depot window and a window will pop up. 
*Add wagons to your engine in the same manner. Two wagons fit in one game world tile.

==Tips==
* Always build stations first.  When you lay a new railway, you will probably destroy some trees and anger a town's [[en/Manual/Local authority]].  The local authority will not let you build a station if you destroy too many buildings or nearby trees.
* When deciding to go over or under an obstruction, [[en/Manual/Tunnels|tunnels]] are preferable to [[en/Manual/Bridges|bridges]]. They are often cheaper and slow [[en/Manual/Trains|trains]] down less.
* It is much more expensive to build track on farmland.
