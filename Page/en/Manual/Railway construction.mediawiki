==Constructing Railways==
First of all, find two industries you can build a train line between. Eg, a coal mine and a power station. You can start construction by pressing the railway build button [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] on the [[en/Manual/Game interface|menu bar]]. Once clicked the Railway Construction window pops up (Fig 1).

If you keep pressed the railway build button, you can choose rail type

==What do all those buttons do?==
From left to right:
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build rail.png]] '''Build Railways buttons''' (shortcut 1-4): [[en/Manual/Building tracks|Builds track]] in the selected direction, you can click and drag for non-diagonal tracks. It is more expensive to build track on farm land.
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build autorail.png]] '''[[en/Archive/Manual/Autorail]] button''': (shortcut A or 5) Click and drag, can also be used to build diagonal tracks (probably needs a better explanation->[[en/Archive/Manual/Autorail]]).
:*[[File:en/Manual/Clear title.png]] '''[[en/Manual/Landscaping|Clear land]] button''' (shortcut 6):Use the dynamite to clear squares of either your own track you've built wrong, or anything that's in your way. Don't demolish too many houses or buildings in a town because your company rating at that town will drop and they won't let you build any stations in their town.
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build traindepot.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Depots|depot]] button''' (shortcut 7): Opens the depot build window for you to select a depot direction to build. The Button will build a depot, for making and servicing vehicles. If you build a depot next to your own track, it will automatically build some track to connect it to your track. Take care to choose the depot facing the way you want it.
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build waypoint.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Waypoints|waypoint]] button''' (shortcut 8): Allows you to build a [[en/Manual/Waypoints]] on/over a rail track.
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build station.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Stations|station]] button''' (shortcut 9): Opens the station build window for you to select a station size and direction to build.
:*[[File:en/Manual/Place signal.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Signals|signal]] button''' (shortcut S):
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build bridge.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Bridges|bridge]] button''' (shortcut B):
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build traintunnel.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Tunnels|tunnel]] button''' (shortcut T): Use this tool to build [[en/Manual/Tunnels|tunnels]]. [[en/Manual/Tunnels]] usually work out cheaper than [[en/Manual/Bridges|bridges]] if possible. They also slow [[en/Manual/Trains|trains]] down less.
:*[[File:en/Manual/Toggle clear active.png]] '''Toggle clear button''' (shortcut R): When you select another tool and this you can remove that item, for example you can remove signals from a rail and leave the rail intact.
:*[[File:en/Manual/Convert rail.png]] '''[[en/Manual/Convert rail]] button''' (shortcut C): Converts Rails from one type to the currently selected type (rail <-> monorail <-> maglev) (or on nightly r4152 and later: rail <-> electrified rail <-> monorail <-> maglev).
:*[[File:en/Manual/Manual html m233f8633.png]] '''Opens [[en/Manual/Landscaping|landscape]] toolbar''' (shortcut L): You'll need this if you need to change the shape of some land to allow your [[en/Manual/Vehicles|vehicles]] to pass through.
:*[[en/Manual/Signal GUI]]
This is in the intergated build and may be in the LATEST nightly.
Several versions have been in the intergated but i`m just covering the latest one. It can also be used to do some other things.

==Types of Railway==
For these releases, electrified rail is added. This gives the following table:
:* [[en/Manual/Base Set/Railways]] - available from the beginning of the game. Both steam and diesel trains run on these railways, electric trains no longer do.
:* [[en/Manual/Base Set/Electrified railways]] - available when electric trains arrive (1965). Steam, diesel and electric trains run on these railways.
:* [[en/Manual/Base Set/Monorail]] - first available around 1999. Only trains built in a Monorail Depot will run on these rails.
:* [[en/Manual/Base Set/MagLev]] - the fastest of the four types of railway, first available around 2022

==Differences to [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]]==
===0.5.0 and newer===
The monorails and maglevs are not merged and there are now electric railways (electric trains require them to run) unlike [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]], where Monorail or Maglev can be sacrificed for a special electric track.

==Building Trains==
To build a [[en/Manual/Trains]], place a train [[en/Manual/Depots]] and then click it. You will be presented with the depot window. Select "Build new vehicles". A new window should pop up with a list of different trains to purchase. Select one you think will be necessary, and then press "Buy Vehicle" at the bottom of this window. The train will then appear in one of the slots in the depot window and a window will pop up. Now that you have added the engine, you must add wagons or vans. To do this, use the Build new vehicles window to choose a wagon or a van suitable for what you want to carry. Once you have, select it and press "Buy vehicle". Repeat as many times as you need, bearing in mind it is two vehicles to a square. Give it orders or refit it as necessary, and then click on the red "Stopped" text to start it!
