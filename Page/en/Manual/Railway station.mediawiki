[[Translation:en/Manual/Railway station]]
'''Railway Stations''' are the core component of any railway network. They allow any and all goods to be loaded and unloaded onto [[en/Manual/Trains]]. For your network, it is best to have your station off the main line so there is no unnecessary traffic passes through them causing delays for trains using the station.

==Train Movement==
There are two ways the trains can move through your station. They can go in and out the same way (as in a terminus station) or in one way and out the other (as in a Ro-Ro station). It is highly recommended that you set the "Train Reversing" option in the Difficulty Level menu to "At End of Line Only." If you set it to "At End of Line, or at Stations," you'll have trains going the wrong way through your stations, which could cause gridlock.
==Terminus==
As the name suggests, these are stations that are at the end of the line. Trains go out the same way they came in. The biggest problem with Terminus stations is that trains entering the station must wait for trains leaving or vice versa, causing unnecessary delays. Because of this, it's best to not use Terminus stations unless space is limited, for example, in cities or mountainous regions.

==Ro-Ro==
Ro-Ro stands for Roll-On, Roll-Off (or Roll In, Roll Out, depending who you ask) - trains roll on from the bottom of the picture and roll off the station from the top. The advantage these have over terminus stations is trains entering the station do not have to wait for trains leaving. This is great for stations that receive medium amounts of traffic because of its simplicity. It's no good for high-traffic stations (e.g., stations serving factories, sawmills, food processing plants etc.) because once all platforms are full, the train waits at the two way signal for the platform closest to the entrance. This can lead to never-ending grid-lock if that train is a goods, steel, paper or food train with full load orders for that station. Note the use of two-way signals. This is explained in [http://www.transporttycoon.net/rail1 Rail Fundamentals].

==Overflow Control==
The two designs above are great if there are only 2 or fewer trains trying to use the station at any one time, but what happens when a third train comes along? The third train sees both that two-way signals are red so picks the closest one, and waits for that train to depart. If the other platform is freed up before the one the third train is waiting for, it will just sit empty. The third train will only go to the first platform. 

There are at least three ways to stop prevent this from occurring: 
===Loop Around===
The first way is a loop around track. The idea behind this is if a train enters the station and sees all the two way signals are red (platforms are full) except the loop around track, it will take the loop around track. This means instead of choosing a random platform and stopping, it loops around and around and around. Every time it loops around, it looks for a free platform. If it finds one, it takes it, if not, it loops around again. The problem with this system is other trains can zip in and steal the free platform while the first train is looping around. Remember to make the looping track long enough so it can fit at least one of your longest trains between the signal at the start and the signal at the end.

===Escape Depot===
A second, less common but better way of controlling station overflow is an "escape depot." This is where there is a depot in the two-way/one-way signal set up at the entrance. Depots automatically have a two way signal in them so behave just like a loop around track. The advantages with an escape depot is, unlike loops, they have an unlimited capacity.

With escape depots, you have to be careful where the depot and the entrance is. There should be a depot at both ends of the two-way/one-way signal set up at the station entrance, as shown in the picture.

Another advantage for the Escape Depot against Loop Around is the train running cost. The trains are constantly moving and you get less profit from each train.

===Pre-Signals===
[[en/Community/Junctionary/Advanced signalling examples|Pre-signals]] are the most common and popular method. The advantage is, unlike the above methods, pre-signal stations with one entrance allow the first train to arrive when the station is full to take the first free platform. The only problem is the queues of trains from these can go over the main line and cause hold ups for trains not going into the station. To solve this, you just need a long approach to the station.

Note: A problem I stumbled accross at the beginning, and ''mpettitt'' mentioned in a [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=8733&highlight=station Forum thread]:
"As mentioned many times on these forums, TRAINS WILL ONLY MAKE CHOICES AT TWO-WAY SIGNALS... [...]
If you want a station to accept trains at any platform, you need to have two-way signals at the entrance."

However, this is not an issue when using NPF (New PathFinding).

==Long Exits==
Normally, when two trains leave a station at once, one must stop and give way to the other. This leaves one train half in the station and half out, leaving that platform unusable to any other trains trying to enter the station. Long exits allow the train to pull out of the station completely before it hits the red signal, freeing up the platform for any trains on their way into the station. Note the length of the exit track, 7 squares - the length of the longest train plus two more squares, so the train can fit neatly between the signals.
[[File:en/Manual/Longexit.png|center|frame|Fig 6. - Long Exits Overflow Control]]
==Double Entrance==
This is the type of design I use for stations that handle a huge number of trains, such as the stations servicing factories or food processing plants. They are a combination of many other ideas listed in the site. This station can not be effectively built without Presignals. An explanation of the signals used in the picture can be found at [[en/Community/Junctionary/Advanced signalling examples]].
[[File:en/Manual/Doubleentrance.png|center|frame|Fig 7. - Double Entrance Overflow Control]]

There are a couple of things you should note about this design:
 
The entrances to the two pre-signal blocks are positioned so the tracks leading to the platform are closer to the entrance than the joining track (with the "combo" signal). This is because trains generally pick the closest available track when they all have two-way signals and all lead to the station. Having trains going to the other pre-signal block when there are available tracks in the first block causes both blocks to be closed unnecessarily, reducing efficiency.
 
The tracks between the pre-signal blocks and the station are one square longer than required. This is so trains don't ever have to slow down to make (unrealistic) ninety degree turns.
 
If one entrance receives more traffic than another, it should have a larger pre-signal block (in this case, 4 platforms compared 3 on the other block). It should also have the lesser number of tracks merging after the station so trains face less delays as they exit.

==[[en/Manual/NewGRF]] Stations==
[[File:en/Manual/Newstationsgui.png|left]]'''NewGRF Stations''' or newstations, are stations that can be built when you have activated a Newstations grf file. You will then have access to a new station building GUI, to build new station styles.

You will be presented with a drop down box of station groups. Within each group will be a number of station tiles to choose from. Select a station tile from the list and it will be previewed in the orientation boxes. Some newstation tiles do not allow trains to enter for the effect of full buildings or buffer stops. Be aware when placing newstation tiles that some tiles do not allow more than so many tracks or squares. The numbers not allowed will be greyed out and you cannot build this size. Some newstations sets offer more visual effects than others. For example, in Michael Blunck's newstations, passengers will gather on station platforms as the waiting cargo increases. This allows the effect of a busy station.

If the station set contains newgrf waypoints, the Waypoint GUI will open upon selecting it. You will have full previews of every waypoint possible for you to build. Most waypoints have introduction and obsoletion dates, in which waypoint styles will be replaced by newer versions. However, any waypoints you have already built will not automatically changed, allowing for variation on your networks. 

Newstations are not different from normal stations, and only the tiles blocking trains can affect gameplay.

See [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] for information on installing NewGRF files.
