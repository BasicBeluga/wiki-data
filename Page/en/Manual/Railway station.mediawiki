[[Translation:en/Manual/Railway station]]
'''Railway Stations''' are the core component of any railway network. They allow any and all goods to be loaded and unloaded onto [[en/Manual/Trains]]. For your network, it is best to have your station off the main line so there is no unnecessary traffic passes through them causing delays for trains using the station.

==Train Movement==
There are two ways the trains can move through your station. They can go in and out the same way (as in a terminus station) or in one way and out the other (as in a Ro-Ro station). It is highly recommended that you set the "Train Reversing" option in the Difficulty Level menu to "At End of Line Only." If you set it to "At End of Line, or at Stations," you'll have trains going the wrong way through your stations, which could cause gridlock.
==Terminus==
These stations are at the end of the line. Trains go out the same way they came in. Trains entering the station must wait for trains leaving and vice-versa, causing unnecessary delays. It's best to not use Terminus stations unless space is limited, as in cities or mountainous regions.

==Ro-Ro==
Ro-Ro stands for Roll-On, Roll-Off (or Roll In, Roll Out, depending who you ask) - trains roll on from the bottom of the picture and roll off the station from the top. The advantage these have over terminus stations is trains entering the station do not have to wait for trains leaving. This is great for stations that receive medium amounts of traffic because of its simplicity. It's no good for high-traffic stations (e.g., stations serving factories, sawmills, food processing plants etc.) because once all platforms are full, the train waits at the two way signal for the platform closest to the entrance. This can lead to never-ending grid-lock if that train is a goods, steel, paper or food train with full load orders for that station. Note the use of two-way signals. This is explained in [http://www.transporttycoon.net/rail1 Rail Fundamentals].

==Overflow Control==
What happens when a third train arrives at one of the above stations? It sees both two-way signals are red, so it just picks the closest one and waits for the light to change. If the other platform empties while the third train is waiting, the platform will stay empty.

Another problem is the queues that form as trains line up to enter a station.  These lines can stretch far, and can even hold up your entire train network!

===Pre-signals===
[[en/Manual/Signals#pre-signals|Pre-signaled]] stations are the most common method to handle overflow. Pre-signal stations make arriving trains wait outside the station until there is a free platform.

===Waiting bay===
A good solution to hold a queue of trains waiting to enter a station is a multi-line waiting bay.  If the station is full, an arriving train picks the closest empty track in the waiting bay.  When a spot opens in the station, one of the waiting trains will move in.  Make sure a train can fit between the signals.  The pre-signals are optional; they help if your waiting bay fills up too!

===Loop around===
Instead of using pre-signals, you can build a loop around track. When a train enters the station and sees all the two way signals are red (platforms are full) except the loop around track, it will take the loop around track. It loops around and around, waiting for a free platform. A problem with this system is other arriving trains can steal the free platform while the first train is looping around. Remember to make the loop big enough to fit at least your longest train.

===Escape depot===
Another way of controlling station overflow is an "escape depot." Place a depot in the two-way/one-way signal set up at the entrance. Depots automatically have a two way signal in them so behave just like a loop around track. Escape depots, unlike loops, have an unlimited capacity. The best layout has a depot at both ends of the station entrance.

==Long Exits==
Normally, when two trains leave a station at once, one must stop and give way to the other. This leaves one train half in the station and half out, leaving that platform unusable to any other trains trying to enter the station. Long exits allow the train to pull out of the station completely before it hits the red signal, freeing up the platform for any trains on their way into the station. Note the length of the exit track, 7 squares - the length of the longest train plus two more squares, so the train can fit neatly between the signals.

==Double Entrance==
This is a type of design used for stations that handle a huge number of trains, such as the stations servicing factories or food processing plants. They are a combination of many other ideas listed in the site. This station can not be effectively built without Presignals. An explanation of the signals used in the picture can be found at [[en/Community/Junctionary/Advanced signalling examples]].
[[File:en/Manual/Doubleentrance.png|center|frame|Fig 7. - Double Entrance Overflow Control]]

There are a couple of things you should note about this design:
 
The entrances to the two pre-signal blocks are positioned so the tracks leading to the platform are closer to the entrance than the joining track (with the "combo" signal). This is because trains generally pick the closest available track when they all have two-way signals and all lead to the station. Having trains going to the other pre-signal block when there are available tracks in the first block causes both blocks to be closed unnecessarily, reducing efficiency.
 
The tracks between the pre-signal blocks and the station are one square longer than required. This is so trains don't ever have to slow down to make (unrealistic) ninety degree turns.
 
If one entrance receives more traffic than another, it should have a larger pre-signal block (in this case, 4 platforms compared 3 on the other block). It should also have the lesser number of tracks merging after the station so trains face less delays as they exit.

==[[en/Manual/NewGRF]] Stations==
{{en/Note|NewGRF stations have been introduced in [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/OpenTTD 0.5.0]].}}

[[File:en/Manual/Newstationsgui.png|left]]'''NewGRF Stations''' or newstations, are stations that can be built when you have activated a Newstations grf file. You will then have access to a new station building GUI, to build new station styles.

You will be presented with a drop down box of station groups. Within each group will be a number of station tiles to choose from. Select a station tile from the list and it will be previewed in the orientation boxes. Some newstation tiles do not allow trains to enter for the effect of full buildings or buffer stops. Be aware when placing newstation tiles that some tiles do not allow more than so many tracks or squares. The numbers not allowed will be greyed out and you cannot build this size. Some newstations sets offer more visual effects than others. For example, in Michael Blunck's newstations, passengers will gather on station platforms as the waiting cargo increases. This allows the effect of a busy station.

If the station set contains newgrf waypoints, the Waypoint GUI will open upon selecting it. You will have full previews of every waypoint possible for you to build. Most waypoints have introduction and obsoletion dates, in which waypoint styles will be replaced by newer versions. However, any waypoints you have already built will not automatically changed, allowing for variation on your networks. 

Newstations are not different from normal stations, and only the tiles blocking trains can affect gameplay.

See [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] for information on installing NewGRF files.
