So imagine you've just finished building up a network of 40 buses covering the landscape, all is peachy. But then, the nightmare... a new bus type arives! Imagine the pain of manually recouping all these buses and replacing them, checking their orders again... a whole year down the drain.

But wait! There is a saviour... The Replace Vehicles feature.

Simply select the type of vehicle you want to replace, and what type of vehicle you want to change it to.. and hey presto, OpenTTD will automatically replace vehicles the next time they visit a depot.

However, OpenTTD will only replace vehicles if you have sufficient funds. If you have less money then the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles]] then when a vehicles enters a depot for its service, you will get an error.

===Where do I find this magical feature?===
Simply click on your list of vehicles, either buses, trains, boats or planes and look for the Replace Vehicles button at the bottom right of the dialog. For example, see the picture below:
