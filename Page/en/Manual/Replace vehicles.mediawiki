So imagine you've just finished building up a network of 40 buses covering the landscape, all is peachy. But then, the nightmare... a new bus type arives! Imagine the pain of manually recouping all these buses and replacing them, checking their orders again... a whole year down the drain.

But wait! There is a saviour... The Replace Vehicles feature.

Simply select the type of vehicle you want to replace, and what type of vehicle you want to change it to.. and hey presto, OpenTTD will automatically replace vehicles the next time they visit a depot.

However, OpenTTD will only replace vehicles if you have sufficient funds. If you have less money then the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles]] then when a vehicles enters a depot for its service, you will get an error.
{{en/Note|Currently if you have "Disable servicing when breakdowns set to none" on and breakdowns off, your vehicles will not go to a depot and therefore will NOT be replaced.}}

===Where do I find this magical feature?===
Simply click on your list of vehicles, either buses, trains, boats or planes and look for the Replace Vehicles button at the bottom right of the dialog. For example, see the picture below:

You may notice that trains have an extra option in the bottom-right corner of the window: "Wagon removal" on/off. If this is option is set to "on", then when a 1-unit locomotive (for example, the Gresley A4) is replaced with a 2-unit locomotive (IC125 for example), the first carriage in the consist will be sold to maintain the original length of the train. 

So, by way of example, if you have a few EE 37s with three passenger carriages and two mail cars each, then replacing them with Metro-Cammel DMUs will give you a few trains with two locomotive units, two passenger carriages and two mail cars each. These trains will be the same overall length as the originals, so they will fit perfectly into your [[en/Manual/Stations]] and signal blocks.

Note that it only works one way; if you were to replace a Metro-Cammel DMU with 4 passenger cars with a BR "40", you would end up with a BR "40"+4 carriages, effectively losing some capacity and giving you a shorter train. The feature will only trim a train to make it fit within the signal blocks and stations you have built; it won't expand a train to make it fill up the original space.
