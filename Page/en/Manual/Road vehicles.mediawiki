==Introduction==
The trucks and buses are the "small fry" of OpenTTD. Useful for passenger and cargo transport where space is scarce (i.e. big cities), but prepare to build a whole lot of them.

The vehicle names were changed in TTD to avoid trademark infringements, and OpenTTD retains the made-up names. They can, however, be changed back by setting "Original vehicle names (ENG)" for the language.

Buses are basically trucks carrying people. However, they need bus stations instead of loading bays.
