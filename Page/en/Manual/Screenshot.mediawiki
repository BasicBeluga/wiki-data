[[Translation:en/Manual/Screenshot]]
A '''screenshot''' is an image of what is seen on the screen. In OpenTTD screenshots are automatically saved to files in the game's installation directory. Screenshots are saved in one of the specified  formats ([https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable Network Graphic PNG], [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP file format BMP] or [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCX PCX]) in the [[en/Manual/Game options window]]. See [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Screenshot format]] for details.

==Types of screenshots ==
''Standard'' depicts only what is actually seen on the screen (including all open menus, windows, dialogs etc.).

The ''Giant screenshot'', on the other hand, saves an image of the whole map at the closest zoom (excluding currently open windows); it does not matter where the user view camera is or what the magnification is. If the map is very large it will take a long time to save the image, and produce a large file.

==Taking a screenshot==
[[File:en/Manual/Screenshot successbox.png|frame|A message of a successful screenshot]]
There are two ways to take a screenshot:
*Opening the ''Other'' ([[File:en/Manual/Manual html 51cda05b.png|Other]]) menu and selecting ''Screenshot'' or ''Giant screenshot''.
*Pressing the ''Ctrl-S'' or ''Ctrl-G'' key combinations on the keyboard for normal and giant screenshots respectively.

A message will be shown once the screenshot has been saved showing the name assigned to the file, which is the name of your company followed by the in-game date.

==Description==
[[en/Manual/Main Page]] has a screenshot function built into it and it can save in several file formats:

:* BMP - The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_bitmap Bitmap] format.
:* PNG - The [http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/ Portable Network Graphics] format.
:* PCX - The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCX ZSoft Paintbrush] format.

To take a screenshot press ''Ctrl-S'' or hold the [http://wiki.openttd.org/index.php/Game_interface#Various Other button] and select ''Screenshot''.

===Screenshots for forum posts===
The preferred format for uploading to the [http://www.tt-forums.net/index.php?c=20 OpenTTD forums] is PNG, for the following reasons.

BMPs are rather large and do not make for good formats to upload to other players.  Since PNG is not as well known as GIF or JPEG formats, the first instinct of many people is to convert the BMP to JPG or GIF.  OpenTTD is not suited to these two file formats. 

Let's look at why:

*The PNG screenshot has no image loss at all.  The file size is 30KB.
*The JPG screenshot is not nearly as sharp.  The file size is 33KB.  More importantly, there is a lot of color loss so that you cannot tell the difference between Combo Signals and Exit Signals.
*The GIF screenshot has no image loss at all,  but the file size is 40KB.
*The optimized PNG screenshot has no image loss at all. The file size is 11KB. (Requires third-party tool, ''[http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm pngout]''.)
*An equivalent colour indexed PNG with no image loss is 11KB. This is becuase OpenTTD at the moment has up to 256 colours only. OpenTTD's PNG output is indexed as standard.

JPG is much better suited for photographs than for solid color art like OpenTTD.  Please use PNG format for all posts to the forum.

{{en/Note|PCX files are a legacy feature as the original Transport Tycoon could only save in PCX format.  PCX files do not compress very much, the example above as a PCX is 233KB.}}
