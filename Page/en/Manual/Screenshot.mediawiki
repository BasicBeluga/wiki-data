[[Translation:en/Manual/Screenshot]]
Screenshot is an image of what is seen on the screen. In OpenTTD screenshots are automatically saved to files in the game's installation directory. Screenshot is saved in one of the specified (PNG, BMP or PCX) formats in the [[en/Manual/Game options window]]. See [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Screenshot format]] for details.

== Types of screenshots ==

Standard '''Screenshot''' depicts only what is actually seen on the screen (including all open menus, windows, dialogs etc.).

The '''Giant screenshot''', on the other hand, saves an image of the ''whole'' map at the closest zoom (excluding currently open windows); it does not matter where the user view camera is or what the magnification is. If the map played if large it takes a lot of time to save the image as well as the file created is very large.

== Taking a screenshot ==

There are two ways to take a screenshot:
*Opening the Other ( [[File:en/Manual/Manual html 51cda05b.png|Other]] ) menu and selecting ''Screenshot'' or ''Giant screenshot''.
*Pressing the Ctrl-S or Ctrl-G key combinations on the keyboard for normal and giant screenshots respectively.

A message of success will be shown once the screenshot has been saved showing the screenshot file's name, which is the name of your company followed by the in-game date.
