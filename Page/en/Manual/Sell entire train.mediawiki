[[Translation:en/Manual/Sell entire train]]
{{en/Expand|A little messy - mentioning converting, not too many details on selling trains, so should be either expanded or moved or merged or deleted}}

For converting huge rail networks when a new tracktype like [[en/Manual/Base Set/Monorail]] or [[en/Manual/Base Set/MagLev]] is introduced, the trains also need to be replaced with maching vehicles. [[en/Manual/Main Page]] has some usability improvements to the original Transport Tycoon game where this task had to be done manually with ''every single wagon''...

Another way to utilise this feature is to change the wagons on a train. For example, if you have an oil train and want to change it to a wood train, all you need to do is drag the first wagon behind the engine, and all the wagons will be sold whilst the engine stays intact! All you have to do is buy the new wagons and change the schedule.
