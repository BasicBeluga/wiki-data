[[Translation:en/Manual/Sell entire train]]
== Prelude ==

So, you made this huge network, and you get to the age of monorail. You want to change youre train network, so you put all trains in the depot, and get on whit the hard work of changing the track. 

*30 min later* pheww, finally done... Just gonna change the trains, and i'm good to go. Grr! This was gonna take 3 sek, but i have to delete every single train vagon one-by one!


== What now? ==

OpenTTD has found a way to counter that; the deleta whole train thing! Now, you can drag the train-engine to the special train-elling icon, and sell the whole thing at once! This significantly decrases the time it takes to do this!


== Alternate use ==

One more good thing this can do. If you have, for example, a oil-train and want to change it to a wood-train, instead of draging the engine to the special icon, you drag the first oil-wagon. Now, all the vagons are sold, but the train stais intact! Now it's just buying the vagons and changing the sceduele...
