{{en/Expand|A little messy - mentioning converting, not too many details on selling trains, so should be either expanded or moved or merged or deleted}}

In the original game converting entire rail networks to [[en/Manual/Base Set/Monorail]] or [[en/Manual/Base Set/MagLev]]was a very time consuming and tedious process.  Tracks had to be manually removed and replaced with the new technology, and each train and carriage had to be sold off one piece at a time.

[[en/Manual/Main Page]] offers a vast improvement on this process.  Entire trains, carriages and all, are able to be sold off in one click.  Alternatively, all of a trains carriages can be sold off at once, leaving the engine and its orders unchanged.
