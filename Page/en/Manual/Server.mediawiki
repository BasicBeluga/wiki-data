[[Translation:en/Manual/Server]]

If you want to host [[en/Manual/Multiplayer|multiplayer network games]], you need to set up the OpenTTD '''server''' on your computer.
== Ports ==
You will almost certainly be using a router to access your Internet connection, or using an external firewall to protect your computer. In this case, you need to tell the router to send game data from players outside of your local/home network to the computer running your OpenTTD server. Else, the data will simply be discarded before it ever reaches the server. This is an example of [Wikipedia:Port forwarding|port forwarding]; in this case, UDP and TCP connections to port '''3979''' will need to be forwarded. (If you can't use port 3979 for some reason, you can make OpenTTD use another port by entering "server_port <number>" into the game's console.)

You will need to check a site such as http://portforward.com/ or your router manual for instructions - there is unfortunately no consistent way of accessing this functionality on all router models. If your router doesn't let you do this at all (there apparently are a few examples), consider yourself ripped off.

Make sure you've instructed the router to send the game data to the correct computer. Now anyone should be able to connect to your OpenTTD server, provided they know your router's IP address (can be obtained by visiting https://www.whatismyip.com/). If you want your server to be visible on the public [http://www.openttd.org/en/servers server list] as well, you will also need to forward UDP connections to port '''3978'''.

== Starting ==
[[File:en/Manual/Ottdmulti6.png|right]]
'''1''' From the Main Menu, click '''Multiplayer'''

'''2''' Click '''Start Server'''

'''3''' Pick a name for your game to help others identify it, and enter it into the '''Game name''' box

'''4''' Configure the additional settings, explained below:

'''5''' Click '''New Game''' (to generate random new game), or '''Load Game''' (to continue an saved game), or '''Play Scenario''', or '''Play Heightmap''', or '''Cancel'''.

'''6''' Test that your server can be reached from outside. If you have enabled advertising, your game will show up on [http://www.openttd.org/servers] at the next refresh of the site cache. If your server is not reachable, usually there is a a firewall or router in the way that needs to be configured.
==Settings==
*'''Set Password''' sets a password for the server so that only users who know the password can join your game.
*'''Connection''' specifies whether the server is for LAN use only, or if it advertises itself to the master server so that it shows up in the internet server list.
*'''Language Spoken''' is for requesting that users speak a certain language on your server.
*'''Max clients''' limits the total number of clients (players and spectators) that can connect.
*'''Max companies''' limits the number of companies at game.
*'''Max spectators''' limits the number of clients who can connect to watch but not play (not-players).
==Dedicated server==
If you are expecting many players and aren't going to be using the machine yourself to play, you can start OpenTTD as a [[en/Manual/Dedicated server]] instead of the usual interactive graphical version.
