If you want to host [[en/Manual/Multiplayer|multiplayer network games]], you need to set up the OpenTTD '''server''' on your computer.

'''1''' From the Main Menu, click '''Multiplayer'''

'''2''' Click '''Start Server'''

'''3''' Pick a name for your game to help others identify it, and enter it into the '''Game name''' box

'''4''' Configure the additional settings, explained below:

'''5''' Click '''New Game''' (to generate random new game), or '''Load Game''' (to continue an saved game), or '''Play Scenario''', or '''Play Heightmap''', or '''Cancel'''.

'''6''' Test that your server can be reached from outside. If you have enabled advertising, your game will show up on [http://www.openttd.org/servers] at the next refresh of the site cache. If your server is not reachable, usually there is a a firewall or router in the way that needs to be configured.

==Settings==
*'''Set Password''' sets a password for the server so that only users who know the password can join your game.
*'''Connection''' specifies whether the server is for LAN use only, or if it advertises itself to the master server so that it shows up in the internet server list.
*'''Language Spoken''' is for requesting that users speak a certain language on your server.
*'''Max clients''' limits the total number of clients (players and spectators) that can connect.
*'''Max companies''' limits the number of companies at game.
*'''Max spectators''' limits the number of clients who can connect to watch but not play (not-players).

==Ports==
If your computer is behind a firewall or [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation NAT] router, which it almost certainly is, you should check that the correct [[en/Manual/Port]]s (both UDP and TCP for 3979 by default) are open and/or forwarded to your computer. Check http://portforward.com/ or your router manual for port forwarding instructions for your router model.
You can change the port used by entering "server_port <port>" into the game's console.

You also need to make sure that the game can communicate with UDP on port 3978 if you want to show up on the server list, as that is used to advertise to the master server.

==Dedicated server==
If you are expecting many players and aren't going to be using the machine yourself to play, you can start OpenTTD as a [[en/Manual/Dedicated server]] instead of the usual interactive graphical version.
