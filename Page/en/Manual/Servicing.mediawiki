[[Translation:en/Manual/Servicing]]
'''Servicing''' is a term that describes a vehicle entering a [[en/Manual/Depots]] or [[en/Manual/Depots]] and having maintenance performed on it. This prolongs the reliability rating somewhat and therefore increases the working life of the vehicle.

==Automatic servicing==
[[en/Manual/Vehicles]] should automatically head to a depot or hangar when they reach the end of their '''service interval'''. This can be changed in the vehicle details, or in the patch options. 

==Scheduled servicing==
[[File:en/Manual/Scheduled servicing.png|thumb|280px||right|Scheduled servicing]]You can also make vehicles go to a depot to service routinely by adding the depot to the vehicle's orders. This way you service the vehicle more regularly, and can help prevent [[en/Archive/Manual/Breakdowns]]. Servicing this way should be scheduled before a train loads its cargo to save time.

==Forced servicing (trains only)==

Trains can be ''forced'' to enter a depot by laying tracks in a way that lets them no choice but to enter a depot. Since there is a noticeable decrease in speed while a train enters and leaves a depot, the number of servicing-lanes should be fit to the amount of traffic.
