[[Translation:en/Manual/Servicing]]
'''Servicing''' is a term that describes a vehicle entering a [[en/Manual/Depots]] or [[en/Manual/Depots]] and having maintenance performed on it. This prolongs the reliability rating somewhat and therefore increases the working life of the vehicle.

[[en/Manual/Vehicles]] should automatically head to a depot or hangar when they reach the end of their '''service interval'''. This can be changed in the vehicle details, or in the patch options. You can also make vehicles go to a depot to service routinely by adding the depot to the vehicle's orders. This way you service the vehicle more regularly, and can help prevent [[en/Archive/Manual/Breakdowns]]. Servicing this way should be scheduled before a train loads its cargo to save time.
