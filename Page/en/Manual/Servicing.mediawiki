[[Translation:en/Manual/Servicing]]
'''Servicing''' is a term that describes a vehicle entering a [[en/Manual/Depots]] or [[en/Manual/Depots]] and having maintenance performed on it. This prolongs the reliability rating somewhat and therefore increases the working life of the vehicle.

==Automatic servicing==
[[en/Manual/Vehicles]] should automatically head to a depot or hangar when they reach the end of their '''service interval'''. This can be changed in the vehicle details, or in the patch options. 

==Scheduled servicing==
[[File:en/Manual/Scheduled servicing.png|thumb|280px||right|Scheduled servicing]]You can also make vehicles go to a depot to service routinely by [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Allow goto depot orders|adding the depot to the vehicle's orders]]. 

This way you service the vehicle more regularly, and can help prevent [[en/Archive/Manual/Breakdowns]]. 

And it also avoid that a vehicle may divert a long trip from its route (or it may even get lost) because it would rush to the nearest depot when it reach the end of their service interval.

Servicing this way should be scheduled before a train loads its cargo to save time.

If you do not want that the vehicle will visit the depot every order list's cycle, use the ''Service'' instruction on the goto depot order: that order is ignored if the servicing intervall is not expired yet.

==Forced servicing (trains only)==

Trains can be ''forced'' to enter a depot by laying tracks in a way that lets them no choice but to enter a depot. Since there is a noticeable decrease in speed while a train enters and leaves a depot, the number of servicing-lanes should be fit to the amount of traffic.
