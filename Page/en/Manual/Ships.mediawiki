Ships are the largest capacity vehicles in OpenTTD, often with the capacity of a small train. However, their slow speed is a large liability. This means a ship can take losses for long periods, until it delivers its goods and earns revenue. While it is possible to have a game only using ships, it is quite difficult. Below is a list of all ships in the game. Click on the name of a ship to get its statistics and details.
