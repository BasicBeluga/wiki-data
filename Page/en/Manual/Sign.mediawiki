Signs are simple notes you can leave on any map square completely free. They are coloured in your company colours.
==Placing a sign==
To place a sign, choose landscaping toolbar and the rightmost icon on it.
Then click a square on the map on which you want to place this sign and enter a text you wish too see there. Remember, that a sign can hold a very limited amount of characters, so you might want to place a few next to each other.
==Editing a sign==
To edit a sign, click on it. An input box appears. Simply enter a new text and click "OK".
==Removing a sign==
To remove a sign, just edit it and remove all text in it.

==Sign list==
Click and hold on a map icon. You'll see a "Sign list" there, where all signs sorted alphabetically are listed there.
