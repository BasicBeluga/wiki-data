[[Translation:en/Manual/Signal GUI]]
This is in the intergated build and may be in the LATEST nightly.
Several versions have been in the intergated but i`m just covering the latest one. It van be used to save you from doing each signal one by one or just the bit you drag along. Insted it places signals at the given distance from each other in the DIRECTION you dragged untill it meets a junction or the end of the line.
It can also make some other things quicker and easyer.

Useing this window you can chosse if you want to use samaphore signals of light signal without haveing to hold down "ctrl".
In order to use auto completion the box with that name is preesed down. If not just click on it.
You can change how often it places signals by changeing the signal desity setting. I recommend you DO NOT use 1 for muilty player as many players will hate you for it as they can not build a bridge over your track with a signal every squae on it.
Below that at the bottom of the window you can choose the type of signal.
To use auto completion make all your choices there then build ONE signal of the type and direction you want the rest to be at one end of the track.
Then click and drag in the direction you want to place signals. It will keep placeing signals untill it hits the end of track , a station or a junction.
