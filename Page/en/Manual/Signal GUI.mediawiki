[[Translation:en/Manual/Signal GUI]]
This is in the intergated build and may be in the LATEST nightly.
Several versions have been in the integrated but I'm just covering the latest one. It can be used to save you from doing each signal one by one or just the bit you drag along. Instead it places signals at the given distance from each other in the DIRECTION you dragged untill it meets a junction or the end of the line.
It can also make some other things quicker and easier.

Using this window you can choose if you want to use samaphore signals of light signals without having to hold down "ctrl".
In order to use auto completion the box with that name is pressed down. If not just click on it.
You can change how often it places signals by changing the signal density setting. I recommend you DO NOT use 1 for multi-player as many players will hate you for it as they can not build a bridge over your track with a signal every square on it.
Below that at the bottom of the window you can choose the type of signal.
To use auto completion make all your choices there then build ONE signal of the type and direction you want the rest to be at one end of the track.
Then click and drag in the direction you want to place signals. It will keep placing signals untill it hits the end of track, a station or a junction.
