The '''Signal GUI''' is a feature in development for OpenTTD which will introduce a new GUI to help with the construct of signals. Currently you must use the CTRL button while building signals to alternate between semaphores, and different types of each signal including the presignal types and the planned PBS. 

The signal GUI was last being worked on by Hackykid. It included autocomplete, a feature allowing signals to be layed along long sections of track with only a few small mouse movements.
