'''Signals''' are useful devices that allow you to control [[en/Manual/Trains]] movement.  They are necessary to make [[en/Manual/Railway construction]] networks work with more than one train.  They keep trains from crashing!

==Placing Signals==
Begin by opening the [[en/Manual/Railway construction]] toolbar and click the signals icon to enter signal build mode.  
[[File:en/Manual/Signals-icon2.png|none|frame|Signal build mode]]
While in signal build mode:

*Click on a clear section of track to place a two-way signal.
*Click on the signal again to toggle it to a one-way signal. 
*Place multiple signals at the same time by clicking an existing signal and [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag-and-drop dragging] the mouse cursor along the track.
*Remove signals by clicking the bulldozer button (while in signal build mode) and then clicking on the unwanted signal.

==Two-way signals==
[[File:en/Manual/Two-way signal.png|frame|left]][[File:en/Manual/2-way signals.png|frame|right|Two-way signals at a loading station]]
Two-way signals are used in a railway that has trains moving in both directions on the same track.  The most common use is at end-of-line stations, where trains enter and exit the same end of the station.  In the example at the right, the signals direct the next train to come to go to the empty loading bay.  They also prevent the train from leaving the loading bay if another train is in the way.<br clear="all" />

==One way signals==
[[File:en/Manual/One-way signal.png|frame|left]]One-way signals limit train movement to one direction.  In the example below, the signals force the trains to move in a circle. This has two advantages: trains enter and exit stations efficiently, and the track can have more than 2 trains.  
*When using one-way signals, be sure that they are <u>all</u> facing the correct direction.
*To place one-way signals, click once to place the signal, and again on the same spot to turn it into a one way signal. The direction can be changed by clicking again.

==Pre-signals==
[[File:en/Manual/Station with pre-signals.png|frame|right|Station with 1 entry pre-signal and 2 exit-signals]]
In railways that have more than one route to the same destination, trains have to decide which route to take. If a route is blocked further down the track, normal signals cannot communicate this to the train. To direct the train to the best route, pre-signals must be used.  The most common use of pre-signals is at loading stations, where trains may have to wait for an open bay.

*Hold Ctrl while clicking a signal to toggle through the 3 kinds of pre-signals: entry, exit, and combo.  

A functioning pre-signal block will have at least an entry and an exit signal.

===Entry Pre-signals===
[[File:en/Manual/Entry presignal.png|frame|left]]An entry presignal tells an incoming train if there are any green exit signals further down the track.  The train will not enter the signal block until there is an available exit.<br clear="all" />

===Exit-signals===
[[File:en/Manual/Exit presignal.png|frame|left]]An exit signal is the same as a normal signal, except that it talks to adjacent entry signals.<br clear="all" />

===Combo-signals===
[[File:en/Manual/Station with pre-signals2.png|frame|right|Station with 1 entry pre-signal, 2 combo-signals, and 4 exit-signals]]
[[File:en/Manual/Combo presignal.png|frame|left]]A combo signal is both an entry and exit signal.  It communicates to an entry presignal if it has available exits.<br clear="all" />

==Semaphores==
[[File:en/Manual/Semaphore.png|frame|left]]The game also has [[en/Manual/Signals]], which are old-style train signals.  They behave the same as a regular signal.
*Hold Ctrl while initially placing a signal to place an semaphore.<br clear="all" />
