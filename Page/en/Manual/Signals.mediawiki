'''Signals''' are useful devices that allow you to control [[en/Manual/Trains]] movement.  They are necessary to keep trains from crashing on [[en/Manual/Railway construction]] networks with more than one train.

==Signal Construction==
[[File:en/Manual/Signals-icon2.png|frame|centre|Signal build mode]]
To do any construction work with signals, you need to be in signal build mode. Open the [[en/Manual/Railway construction]] toolbar and click the signals icon to enter this.

Then, while in signal build mode:
*To '''place a signal''', click on a clear section of track.  To begin with this will be a ''two way signal'', the most basic type. See below for how to change this to a different type.  If placing a signal where two parallel tracks share a map square, ensure you click on the precise track you wish to signal.
*Place '''multiple signals''' at the same time by clicking an existing signal and [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag-and-drop dragging] the mouse cursor along the track.  They will be spaced as set in the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Drag signal density]] patch.
*'''Remove signals''' by clicking the [[File:en/Manual/Toggle clear active.png]] bulldozer button (while remaining in signal build mode) and then clicking on the unwanted signal.  You can drag to remove multiple signals.

You cannot construct signals on a square shared by more than one piece of track unless the tracks are parallel.

==Two-way signals==
[[File:en/Manual/Two-way signal.png|frame|left]][[File:en/Manual/2-way signals.png|frame|right|Two-way signals at a loading station]]
Two-way signals are used in a railway that has trains moving in both directions on the same track.  The most common use is at end-of-line stations, where trains enter and exit the same end of the station.  In the example at the right, the signals direct the next train to come to go to the empty loading bay.  They also prevent the train from leaving the loading bay if another train is in the way.

If a train has a choice of two or more directions, each with two-way signals on them, it will choose the direction with a green signal.  If all signals are red it will pick any and stop at the signal.

==One way signals==
[[File:en/Manual/One-way signal.png|frame|left]]
One-way signals limit train movement to one direction.  In the example below, the signals force the trains to move in a circle. This has two advantages: trains enter and exit stations efficiently, and the track can have more than 2 trains.  

When using one-way signals, be sure that they are ''all'' facing the correct direction.  It is a good idea to watch the first train you run on the newly signalled line all the way to its destination to ensure you haven't made any mistakes.

Click on an existing two-way signal to toggle it to a one-way signal. Click on it again to change its direction (leaving it one-way); the third time will revert it back to a two-way signal.

If a train has a choice of tracks, each with a two way signal, it will pick its direction track as if there were no signals (i.e. it does not take any notice of the colour a signal is showing).  This is in contrast with two way signals.

If a train arrives at the wrong side of a one-way signal it will immediately reverse.

==Pre-signals==
[[File:en/Manual/Station with pre-signals.png|frame|right|Station with 1 entry pre-signal and 2 exit-signals]]
In railways that have more than one route to the same destination, trains have to decide which route to take. If a route is blocked further down the track, normal signals cannot communicate this to the train. To direct the train to the best route, pre-signals must be used.  The most common use of pre-signals is at loading stations, where trains may have to wait for an open bay.

'''Hold Ctrl while clicking a signal to toggle through the 3 kinds of pre-signals: entry, exit, and combo.'''

A functioning pre-signal block will have at least an entry and an exit signal.

Note that you can build one way pre-signals in the same way as you build ordinary one way signals.  Remember: holding ''Ctrl'' and clicking toggles the type of (pre)signal, clicking without ''Ctrl'' changes the direction of signalling.

===Entry Pre-signals===
[[File:en/Manual/Entry presignal.png|frame|left]]An entry presignal shows green as long as there is at least one green exit signal on the following section of track.  Otherwise it shows red.  This prevents trains from entering the signal block until there is an available exit.{{en/-}}

===Exit-signals===
[[File:en/Manual/Exit presignal.png|frame|left]]An exit signal behaves in the same way as a normal signal but is necessary to trigger the correct colour on entry and combo pre-signals.{{en/-}}

===Combo-signals===
[[File:en/Manual/Station with pre-signals2.png|frame|right|Station with 1 entry pre-signal, 2 combo-signals, and 4 exit-signals]]
[[File:en/Manual/Combo presignal.png|frame|left]]A combo signal is both an entry and exit signal.  It communicates to an entry presignal if it has available exits.{{en/-}}

==Semaphores==
[[File:en/Manual/Semaphore.png|frame|left]]The game also has [[en/Manual/Signals]]s, which are old-style train signals.  They behave the same as a regular signal.
