[[Translation:en/Manual/Signals]]
'''Signals''' are useful devices that allow you to control [[en/Manual/Trains]] movement.  They are necessary to make [[en/Manual/Railway construction]] networks work with more than one train.

==Placing Signals==
[[File:en/Manual/Signals-icon2.png|none|frame|Signal build mode|right]]
Begin by opening the [[en/Manual/Railway construction]] toolbar and click the signals icon to enter signal build mode.  While in signal build mode:

*Click on a clear section of track to place a two-way signal.
*Click on the signal again to toggle it to a one-way signal. 
*Place multiple signals at the same time by clicking an existing signal and [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag-and-drop dragging] the mouse cursor along the track.
*Remove signals by clicking the bulldozer button (while in signal build mode) and then clicking on the unwanted signal.
*Hold Ctrl while initially placing a signal to place an old-style [[en/Manual/Signals|semaphore]], which behaves the same as a regular signal.
*Hold Ctrl while clicking a signal to toggle [[en/Manual/Signals]].

==Two-way signals==
[[File:en/Manual/2-way signals.png|frame|right|Two-way signals at a loading station]]
Two-way signals are used in a railway that has trains moving in both directions on the same track.  The most common use is at end-of-line stations, where trains enter and exit the same end of the station.<br clear="all" />

==One way signals==
One-way signals limit train movement to one direction, and allow for more efficient train running.  In the image on the right, trains are forced to move around a loop. The next train can enter the station much faster than in the previous two-way signal example.
