'''Signals''' are useful devices that allow you to control [[en/Manual/Trains]] movement.  They are necessary to keep trains from crashing on [[en/Manual/Railway construction]] networks with more than one train.

==Signal Construction==
[[File:en/Manual/Signals-icon2.png|frame|centre|Signal build mode]]
To do any construction work with signals, you need to be in signal build mode. Open the [[en/Manual/Railway construction]] toolbar and click the signals icon to enter this.

Then, while in signal build mode:
*To '''place a signal''', click on a clear section of track.  To begin with this will be a ''two way signal'', the most basic type. See below for how to change this to a different type.  If placing a signal where two parallel tracks share a map square, ensure you click on the precise track you wish to signal.
*Place '''multiple signals''' at the same time by clicking an existing signal and [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag-and-drop dragging] the mouse cursor along the track.  They will be spaced as set in the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Drag signal density]] patch and will be of the same type as the signal you started the drag  at.
*'''Remove signals''' by clicking the [[File:en/Manual/Toggle clear active.png]] bulldozer button (while remaining in signal build mode) and then clicking on the unwanted signal.  You can drag to remove multiple signals.

You cannot construct signals on a square shared by more than one piece of track unless the tracks are parallel.

==Two-way signals==
[[File:en/Manual/Two-way signal.png|frame|left]][[File:en/Manual/2-way signals.png|frame|right|Two-way signals at a loading station]]
Two-way signals are used in a railway that has trains moving in both directions on the same track.  The most common use is at end-of-line stations, where trains enter and exit the same end of the station.  In the example at the right, the signals direct the next train to come to go to the empty loading bay.  They also prevent the train from leaving the loading bay if another train is in the way.

If a train has a choice of two or more directions, each with two-way signals on them, it will choose the direction with a green signal.  If all signals are red it will pick the easiest direction and wait for the signal to change.

==One way signals==
[[File:en/Manual/One-way signal.png|frame|left]]
One-way signals limit train movement to one direction.  In the example below, the signals force the trains to move in a circle. This has two advantages: trains enter and exit stations efficiently, and the track can have more than 2 trains.  

When using one-way signals, be sure that they are ''all'' facing the correct direction.  It is a good idea to watch the first train you run on the newly signalled line all the way to its destination to ensure you haven't made any mistakes.

Click on an existing two-way signal to toggle it to a one-way signal. Click on it again to change its direction (leaving it one-way); the third time will revert it back to a two-way signal.

If a train has a choice of tracks, each with a two way signal, it will pick its direction track as if there were no signals (i.e. it does not take any notice of the colour a signal is showing).  This is in contrast with two way signals.

If a train arrives at the wrong side of a one-way signal it will immediately reverse.

==Pre-signals==
[[File:en/Archive/Manual/WhyPresignals.png|frame|right|A problem]]
The image on the right shows a setup where entry to a station is controlled using ordinary signals.  When at least one platform is empty this works well as an incoming train is always directed to a free platform.  However, consider what happens when all platforms are full as in the screenshot.  All branches are showing red so incoming train ''D'' picks the easiest - straight on.  But suppose train ''B'' is going to be in the station for some time.  Meanwhile train ''C'' leaves.  Train ''D'' has committed itself to a platform and is stuck waiting for ''B'' to depart even though there is now an empty platform available!  We need to stop train ''D'' passing signal ''1'' and having to make a decision between three red signals. Enter '''pre-signals'''.

Pre-signals are signals that decide on which colour to show not only by the status of the track immediately beyond, but also by the status of other pre-signals further down the line.  Specifically, a pre-signal shows a green light if, and only if, there is a green exit from the block behind it.  You as the planner need to identify which signals are to be the pre-signals and which are to identify exits.

===Entry Pre-signals===
[[File:en/Manual/Entry presignal.png|frame|left]]An entry presignal shows green as long as there is at least one green exit signal on the following section of track.  Otherwise it shows red.  This prevents trains from entering the signal block until there is an available exit.

If there are no signals designated as exits behind the entry pre-signal, it behaves as a normal signal.  This is convenient for bi-directional presignals where only one direction needs presignal functionality.

===Exit-signals===
[[File:en/Manual/Exit presignal.png|frame|left]]An exit signal behaves in the same way as a normal signal but is necessary to trigger the correct colour on entry and combo pre-signals.

With NPF disabled, exits should normally be two-way signals, so as to give the train a choice. With one-way signals and no NPF, the train would be permitted to pass the entry signal as normal as soon as one of the exits cleared.  However, it would then pick exit to the shortest path to its destination, which would not necessarily be a green signal!

NPF lifts this "restriction" and trains will choose the least cost path to their destination.  Red signals have a higher cost than green, so trains will not wait at them if it can be avoided.

===Combo-signals===
[[File:en/Manual/Station with pre-signals2.png|frame|right|Station with 1 entry pre-signal, 2 combo-signals, and 4 exit-signals]]
[[File:en/Manual/Combo presignal.png|frame|left]]There is a third type of presignal that doesn't really introduce any new functionality.  It is called the '''combo signal''' and simply acts as both an entry and exit signal.  This allows you to build large "trees" of presignals as shown on the right.

===Building Presignals===
[[File:en/Presig1.png|frame|left|Solving a similar problem to the one outlined at the start of the section, using presignals]]
To build presignals, first place an ordinary signal.  Then, with ''Ctrl'' held down, click the signal to cycle through the different kinds of presignal.

Note that you can build one way pre-signals in the same way as you build ordinary one way signals.  Remember: holding ''Ctrl'' and clicking toggles the type of (pre)signal, clicking without ''Ctrl'' changes the direction of signalling.

Remember not to hold down ''Ctrl'' when placing the signal initially or you will end up with a semaphore (see below).

==Semaphores==
[[File:en/Manual/Semaphore.png|frame|left]]
'''Semaphores''' are a type of signal with no functional difference from regular signals.  They simply have a different (old-style) appearance.

You can create Semaphores instead of normal signals by holding ''Ctrl'' while placing the signals. After placement, holding ''Ctrl'' and clicking changes the extended signal status of the signals. You cannot change pre-placed semaphores to signal lights, though you may remove them and re-add them as you would like.
{{en/-}}
===History===
Semaphore signals have a long history in rail lines. Long before the advent of electric lights, Semaphores were used to indicate the direction of switch-tracks, and the safety of going into the tracks beyond. Semaphores are simply mechanically controlled signs that raise or lower based upon the status of the track.

In the original Transport Tycoon, rail signals created before 1975 were semaphores. Afterwards, signals were created as standard coloured lights. Transport Tycoon Deluxe removed this functionality, but it has been restored in TTDPatch and OpenTTD.

==Directing trains==
Note that signals are not the best way to direct trains to completely separate destinations (just to prevent them crashing and help them choose between several track sections to the same destination).  If you want to do that, you should use [[en/Manual/Waypoints]].
