[[Translation:en/Manual/Signals]]
'''Signals''' are useful devices that allow you to control [[en/Manual/Trains]] movement.  They are necessary to make [[en/Manual/Railway construction]] networks work with more than one train.

==Placing Signals==
[[File:en/Manual/Signals-icon2.png|none|frame|Signal build mode|right]]
Begin by opening the [[en/Manual/Railway construction]] toolbar and click the signals icon to enter signal build mode.  While in signal build mode:

*Click on a clear section of track to place a two-way signal.
*Click on the signal again to toggle it to a one-way signal. 
*Place multiple signals at the same time by clicking an existing signal and [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag-and-drop dragging] the mouse cursor along the track.
*Remove signals by clicking the bulldozer button (while in signal build mode) and then clicking on the unwanted signal.
*Hold Ctrl while initially placing a signal to place an old-style [[en/Manual/Signals|semaphore]], which behaves the same as a regular signal.
*Hold Ctrl while clicking a signal to toggle [[en/Manual/Signals]].

==Two-way signals==
[[File:en/Manual/2-way signals.png|frame|right|Two-way signals at a loading station]]
Two-way signals are used in a railway that has trains moving in both directions on the same track.  The most common use is at end-of-line stations, where trains enter and exit the same end of the station.  In the example at the right, the signals direct the next train to come to go to the empty loading bay.  They also prevent the train from leaving the loading bay if another train is in the way.<br clear="all" />

==One way signals==
One-way signals limit train movement to one direction.  In the example below, the signals force the trains to move in a circle. This has two advantages: trains enter and exit stations efficiently, and the track can have more than 2 trains.  
*When using one-way signals, be sure that they are <u>all</u> facing the correct direction.
