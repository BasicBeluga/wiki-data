Since OpenTTD version 14, there is support for integration with various social platforms in OpenTTD via plugins for each social platform. Currently, plugins are available for [https://www.openttd.org/downloads/discord-social-releases/latest Discord], [https://www.openttd.org/downloads/steam-social-releases/latest Steam], and [https://www.openttd.org/downloads/gog-galaxy-social-releases/latest GOG Galaxy].

After downloading the relevant plugin, it must be manually installed.

For '''Windows''' and '''Linux''', the downloaded archive should be extracted into the <code>social_integration</code> folder within your OpenTTD data directory. On Windows this is generally <code>Documents\OpenTTD</code>, on Linux [https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/blob/master/docs/directory_structure.md it varies].

For '''Mac OS''', there is an Install script within the download that should be run to install the plugin.

After successfully installing a plugin, it will be shown in the "Social" tab of Game Options.
