[[Translation:en/Manual/Station list]]
The '''station list''' is accessible by holding the [[File:en/StationListButton.png]] button and selecting the company whose stations you want to view. 

It provides a list of all the [[en/Manual/Stations]] owned by a company, with details on the type and quantity of [[en/Manual/Cargo]] and the [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#station-rating|quality of service]] at each station.

You can click on a station name to be taken to it, useful if you're lost on a large map, or want to investigate a problem.

==Filtering and sorting the list==

Using the buttons at the top you can filter the station list to show only certain types of [[en/Manual/Stations]] ([[en/Manual/Railway station|railway stations]], [[en/Manual/Loading Bays#lorry-loading-bay|lorry loading bay]], [[en/Manual/Loading Bays#bus-loading-bay|bus loading bay]], [[en/Manual/Airports]] and [[en/Manual/Water Transport Tiles]] ) or filter only stations servicing certain types of [[en/Manual/Cargo]] (passengers, goods, etc.) or both (passenger trains, mail trucks, etc.). Hold down Ctrl to select more than one item. You can also use the All button to quickly select alla stations types; and you can use the No and All buttons to quickly (de)select all cargo types. Note that when filtering for a cargo type only stations currently holding some will show up, so a station will not show up if all available cargo of that type has just been loaded.

You can sort the station list by the following criteria:
:*Name
:*Station type
:*Waiting cargo value
:*Cargo rating

You can then list them in ascending or descending order by clicking the ''"Sort by"'' button.

==Station status==

From left to right the station list contains the following information:
:*Station name
:*Vehicle types that station services
:* Amount of [[en/Manual/Cargo]] waiting at the station (the upper and bigger blu bar) and rating of [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#station-rating|quality of service]] (the lower and smaller green/red bar) for each cargo at the station.
