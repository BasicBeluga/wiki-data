[[Translation:en/Manual/Station list]]
The '''station list''' is accessible by holding the [[File:en/StationListButton.png]] button and selecting the company whose stations you want to view.  It provides details on the type and quantity of cargo and the quality of service at each station.

You can click on a station name to be taken to it, useful if you're lost on a large map, or want to investigate a problem.
