[[Translation:en/Manual/Station list]]
The '''station list''' is accessible by holding the [[File:en/StationListButton.png]] button and selecting the company whose stations you want to view.  It provides details on the type and quantity of cargo and the quality of service at each station.

You can click on a station name to be taken to it, useful if you're lost on a large map, or want to investigate a problem.

==Filtering and sorting the list==

Using the buttons at the top you can filter the station list to show only certain types of stations (train, truck, etc.) or only stations servicing certain types of cargo (passengers, goods, etc.). Hold down Ctrl to select more than one item or use the No and All buttons to quickly (de)select all cargo types. Note that when filtering for a cargo type only stations currently holding some will show up, so a station will not show up if all available cargo of that type has just been loaded.

You can sort the station list by the following criteria:
:*Name
:*Station type
:*Waiting cargo value
:*Cargo rating

You can then list them in ascending or descending order by clicking the ''"Sort by"'' button.

==Station status==

From left to right the station list contains the following information:
:*Station name
:*Vehicle types that station services
:*Cargo waiting at the station, the coloured background represents the amount of cargo and the green/red bar represents the approval rating
