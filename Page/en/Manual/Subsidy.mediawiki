[[Translation:en/Manual/Subsidy]]
A '''Transport Subsidy''' or '''Subsidy''' is an incentive for you to transport goods between two specific locations. The [[en/Manual/Local authority]] will usually notify all players about the subsidy through the Newspaper. Any subsidies available, or any subsidies you have been awarded will appear on this screen:

The Local Authority will offer money for taking this subsidy, which can differ between twice the original revenue and four times the original revenue. Through this, players that take advantages of all subsidies can find themselves making more money than players who do not. 

Subsidies are a good way for new players who join a [[en/Manual/Multiplayer]] game to get a strong foothold easily.
