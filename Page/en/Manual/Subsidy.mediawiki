[[Translation:en/Manual/Subsidy]]
A '''Transport Subsidy''' or '''Subsidy''' is an incentive for you to transport a designated type of [[en/Manual/Cargo|cargo]] from one specific location to another. The [[en/Manual/Local authority]] will usually notify all players about the subsidy through the Newspaper. Any subsidies available, or any subsidies you or other companies in the game have been awarded (either AI or player-controlled) will appear on this screen:

Open this screen by clicking on the Subsidies button: [[File:en/Manual/Manual html 54594ccb.png|Subsidies]].

The Local Authority will increase the amount of revenue made by delivering the designated cargo type between the two locations mentioned in the subsidy, which can range from twice the original revenue up to four times the original revenue. Players that take advantages of subsidies can find themselves making more money than players who do not.

Subsidies are a good way for new players who join a [[en/Manual/Multiplayer]] game to get a strong foothold easily.
