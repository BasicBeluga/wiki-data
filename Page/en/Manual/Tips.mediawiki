This page contains handy tips and tricks for OpenTTD.

*Did you know that you can sell an entire train all at once by dragging the engine onto the dynamite icon?

*Press Shift while performing an action (e.g. laying track, buying a bridge or tunnel) to see how much it would cost without actually doing it.

*Use "Shared Orders".  If you have more than one bus (or any other vehicle) travelling the same route, you know that you can copy the orders from one of the vehicles onto another by clicking the orders button and then the vehicle that has the orders you want to copy...  But did you know that if you press Ctrl when you click the vehicle, both vehicles will share the same set of orders so that if you ever need to change the orders (e.g. you need to send them both to another new station), every vehicle with those "Shared Orders" will see the change as well.

*Try to make sure that any inner-city road vehicle stations are within a loop of road.  A road vehicle station can only take two vehicles at a time... any more and they will try to "go around the block" and come back to the station.  If your station is inside a loop of road then they can circle the town and return when the station is clear.  If not, they might wander off miles out of their way!

*Remember to upgrade your bridges as the game progresses.  At the start of the game, cheap bridges can suffice and save you lots of money, but once the new, stronger bridges appear there's no point having a 200mph monorail train having to slow to 30mph to cross a rickety old wooden bridge!
