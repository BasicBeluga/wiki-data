'''Towns''' are where the inhabitants of OpenTTD live. 

Each town is managed by a [[en/Manual/Local authority]] who determine which actions a [[en/Manual/Transport company]] may take in each town. Landscaping, bulldozing, clearing trees and destroying industries all lower the company rating in the town. However, planting trees, successful bribes and providing a passenger/mail service to the town increases the company rating. To place a station, the company must have a minimum rating of -200 (Poor).

The [[en/Archive/Manual/Building|buildings]] in the towns provide a source of [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Passengers]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Mail]] which can be transported to other towns or within the same town. Larger buildings produce larger amounts of passengers and mail, therefore placing stations in the centre of the town increases the passenger flow. The exception is the Warehouse, which produces no passengers or mail, but fully accepts goods. 

Larger buildings partly accept goods in the Temperate, Sub-Arctic and Sub-Tropical climates. In the Sub-Artic and Sub-Tropical they also accept food. Delivery of Goods or Food can help to increase the rate of town growth. 

Certain Industries must be contained within a town, notably the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Bank]] which can only be found in towns with populations of over 1000, and the Water Tower found in desert towns in the Sub-Tropical climate. Deliveries of Water and Food are necessary for a desert town to grow.

If the [[en/Manual/Cheats#magic-bulldozer|Magic bulldozer]] cheat is checked, then there is the risk that the town could accidentally demolish an industry should it expand into the vicinity. 

==Growth==
Towns require passenger transportation to grow, although they grow slowly without any help. Goods and food can increase the rate of growth where accepted, and water is necessary for desert towns.
 
A simple bus service can drastically increase the population of a town. It is sensible to connect not-too-distant small towns together with bus services to bulk-up their population before a train station or airport becomes viable. Alternatively, creating a bus route within a larger town can produce an even higher rate of growth. 

In short, the growth of a town is heavily dependant on the number of passengers picked up ''and'' delivered, regardless of origin. A bus-full of passengers from the other side of town has the same effect on growth as one carriage of passengers from the other end of the map. A town with a feeder station where passengers are picked up but not set down will also grow.

==Cities==
{{en/Nightly}}
A city is a special form of town that will grow twice as fast as a regular town. A city is also larger to begin with. There are two patch settings that affect cities: ''Number of towns that will become cities'', and ''Initial city size multiplier''.

==Climate-related Conditions==
===Temperate===
There are no conditions for a Temperate town to grow, unlike the Sub-Arctic and Sub-Tropical climates so a mere passenger service will suffice. Goods can accelerate the growth of a town, although it is the number of passengers delivered to the town which has the most impact.

===Sub Arctic===
Towns where the centre square is above the snow level need monthly food supplies to grow. Although there is no requirement for the level of food to induce growth, the rate of expansion can be increased slightly by increasing the food supply.

The towns grow very slowly on their own, although food must be delivered for a passenger service to have an impact. In the case of small towns not large enough to accept food, it is simply a case of waiting for them to grow slowly on their own before they will accept food.

===Sub Tropical=== 
Any town where the centre square is in the desert requires [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Food]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Water]] to grow. Non-desert towns require neither food nor water.
[[File:en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Water tower.gif|right]]
Water must be delivered to a Water Tower, not stright to ordinary buildings as they obviously do not accept water in the form of large tankers. Water Towers may be generated automatically, else they must be built by the player. Any amount of water delivered to a town satisfies the need for water for that month. Excessive water supply does not increase the rate of growth, unlike food.

===Toyland===
Toyland is similar to the Temperate Climate, where there are no requirements for growth. Toys and Sweets (the equivalent of Goods and Food respectively) can help to accelerate the growth of a town.
