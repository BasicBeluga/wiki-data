[[Translation:en/Manual/Towns]]
The towns are where the inhabitants of OpenTTD live. 

Each town is managed by a [[en/Manual/Local authority]] that determines what actions a [[en/Manual/Transport company]] may take in each town.

The [[en/Archive/Manual/Building]]s in the towns provide a source of [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Passengers]]s and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Mail]] which can be transported to other towns or even to other places within the same town.

After a period of [[en/Growth]], the towns start producing buildings that can accept [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Goods]]. In other climates, towns can also accept [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Food]], [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Water]], [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Sweets]] and [[en/Fizzy drinks]].

If the [[en/Archive/Manual/Magic bulldozer]] option is checked, then there is the risk that the town could accidentally demolish an industry.

==How to grow a town==
A town needs passenger transportation.
===Temperate===
Temperate cities just needs serviced stations to growth (passengers or anything else).

The impact on growth is from 1 station to 4 stations. With one station, it will grow "slowly" and with 4 stations it will grow very fast. A good way to get shortly a lot of passengers in a train station is to build a train station beside the city, then add 4 buses stops. After several month only, the town will grow a lot, and your train station will be very well supplied with thousands of passengers.

In the early ages, it's hard to spend much money with buses. So you should concentrate on industries only. A station at an industry owned by a city do the same as a station in the city, so the town will grow according the same rules.

===Desert=== 
[[File:en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Water tower.gif|right]]The desert town needs water and food each month. The quantity doesn't matter. These cities appear only in sub-tropic climate and you will easy see which ones count as desert cities since they have [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Water Tower]]s.

===Arctic===
Towns above snow level need monthly food supplies to grow.

===Toyland===
