[[Translation:en/Manual/Tramways]]
'''Trams''' are a new, currently [[en/Archive/Community/Nightly build|nightly only]] feature within OpenTTD that allows you to construct [[en/Manual/Tramways]], which can be built on open ground and on existing road systems. The default tram infastructure graphics are provided by [[en/Archive/Community/Users/PikkaBird]].

Trams will not work unless you currently have an active tram vehicle [[en/Manual/NewGRF]]. If you do not, you cannot construct tram tracks. Trams require their own [[en/Manual/Depots]] and infrastructure, as do other transportation systems. 

==Availability==
Due to this being a relatively new feature in OpenTTD and TTDPatch, there are not many Tram vehicle GRFs yet fully completed. There are However, a few pre-release or test versions which can be found listed on the [[en/Community/NewGRF/Main Page]] or [http://grfcrawler.tt-forums.net/index.php?do=list&cid=105 GRF Crawler]. Please also look through [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=26 TT-Forums] for in development tram vehicle sets.
