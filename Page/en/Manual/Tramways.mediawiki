'''Trams''' are a feature of [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/OpenTTD 0.6.0]] that allows you to construct [[en/Manual/Tramways]], which can be built on open ground and on existing road systems. The default tram infastructure graphics are provided by [[en/Archive/Community/Users/PikkaBird]]. To play with trams, you need an active tram vehicle [[en/Manual/NewGRF]]. As with other transportation systems, trams require their own infrastructure, including [[en/Manual/Depots]]. {{en/Html-clear-left}}

==Availability==

Due to this being a relatively new feature in OpenTTD and [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]], there are not many tram vehicle GRFs yet fully completed. There are however, a few pre-release or test versions which can be found listed on the [[en/Community/NewGRF/Main Page]] or [http://grfcrawler.tt-forums.net/index.php?do=list&cid=105 GRF Crawler]. Please also look through [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=26 TT-Forums] for tram vehicle sets.
