Tunnels are useful for going under things you cannot move, or things that are too expensive to remove, like large mountains for example. They can also be used in [[en/Community/Junctionary/Main Page]] in place of [[en/Manual/Bridges]]. One thing you should keep in mind about tunnels is that vehicles of any speed can pass through them without slowing down, as is often the case with [[en/Manual/Bridges]].

For additional info see '''[[en/Manual/Bridges#building-bridges-for-beginners|Building bridges for beginners]]''', the procedure is basically the same but for underground.
And you cannot choose what type of tunnel you will build, they are all the same!
