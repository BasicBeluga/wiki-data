Tunnels are useful for going under things you cannot move, or things that are too expensive to remove, like large mountains for example.
You can dig a tunnel under a city, station, diagonal tracks or some industries, but you can't build a bridge over these.
They can also be used in [[en/Community/Junctionary/Main Page]] in place of [[en/Manual/Bridges]]. One thing you should keep in mind about tunnels is that vehicles of any speed can pass through them without slowing down, as is often the case with [[en/Manual/Bridges]].


==Building Tunnels for beginners==
You can dig road and railway tunnel. Choose between road and railway tunnels only at the beginning. Simply, click on railway build button [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] or road build button [[File:en/Manual/Manual html ma6d6c8c.png]] on the [[en/Manual/Game interface|menu bar]]. Once clicked the Railway Construction (Fig 1) or Road Construction (Fig 2) window pops up.

[[File:en/Manual/Road constructionnew.png|center|frame|'''Fig 2. - The Road Construction Toolbar''']]
</center>

Now just click on tunnel building button: railway [[File:en/Manual/Build traintunnel.png]] or road [[File:en/Manual/Build roadtunnel.png]]

In this tutorial we will focus on railway tunnels, but don't worry: constructing road tunnel is the same!

Move the cursor around the map to find a good spot for a tunnel. You can't dig a tunnel on a flat land, so the tile will be just highlighted (Fig 3).

However, if you move the cursor over a slope, you can check the patch of the tunnel you are about to build (Fig 4).
<center>[[File:en/Manual/Tunnel prepare first.png|center|frame|'''Fig 4. - Tunnel can be dug here''']]</center>

To actually build the tunnel, just click on the sloped tile (Fig 5).
<center>[[File:en/Manual/Tunnel built first.png|center|frame|'''Fig 5. - Congratulations, you have just dug a tunnel''']]</center>


See also '''[[en/Manual/Bridges#building-bridges-for-beginners|Building bridges for beginners]]''', the procedure is basically the same but for underground.
And you cannot choose what type of tunnel you will build, they are all the same!

==Advanced Tunnel building==

If there is a slope in an odd direction at the end of the tunnel (Fig 6), it will automaticly lowered so the tunnel can be dug (Fig 7). However, you can't start digging the tunel at such a slope; you must terraform it manually.
<center>[[File:en/Manual/Tunnel prepare second.png|center|frame|'''Fig 6. - Tunnel construction is possible even if it ends at an oddly-directed slope''']]
[[File:en/Manual/Tunnel built second.png|center|frame|'''Fig 7. - The slope will be automatically lowered in order to dig a tunnel''']]</center>

Sometimes, the odd directed slope can't be lowered automatically because of obstacles on surrounding tiles (Fig 8). You will see an error window saying so (Fig 9). 
<center>[[File:en/Manual/Tunnel terraform third.png|center|frame|'''Fig 8. - Automatic slope lowering is impossible''']]</center>
<center>[[File:en/Manual/Tunnel error third.png|center|frame|'''Fig 9. - The error message appears''']]</center>

You should raise the land manually, so the tunnel ends at [[en/Development/Directions|NW, NE, SW or SE]] slope (Fig 10).
<center>[[File:en/Manual/Tunnel prepare third.png|center|frame|'''Fig 10. - The tunnel is ready to be built''']]</center>
Now you're ready to dig a tunnel (Fig 11).
