Tunnels are useful for going under things you cannot move, or things that are too expensive to remove, like large mountains for example. They can also be used in [[en/Community/Junctionary/Main Page]] in place of [[en/Manual/Bridges]]. One thing you should keep in mind about tunnels is that vehicles of any speed can pass through them without slowing down, as is often the case with [[en/Manual/Bridges]].


==Building Tunnels for beginners==
You can dig road and railway tunnel. Choose between road and railway tunnels only at the beginning. Simply, click on railway build button [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] or road build button [[File:en/Manual/Manual html ma6d6c8c.png]] on the [[en/Manual/Game interface|menu bar]]. Once clicked the Railway Construction (Fig 1) or Road Construction (Fig 2) window pops up.

</center>

Now just click on tunnel building button: railway [[File:en/Manual/Build traintunnel.png]] or road [[File:en/Manual/Build roadtunnel.png]]

In this tutorial we will focus on railway tunnels, but don't worry: constructing road tunnel is the same!

Move the cursor around the map to find a good spot for a tunnel. You can't dig a tunnel on a flat land, so the tile will be just highlighted (Fig 3).

However, if you move the cursor over a slope, FIXME:"you will see where would be the tunnel dug" (Fig 4).

To actually build the tunnel, just click on the sloped tile (Fig 5).

See also '''[[en/Manual/Bridges#building-bridges-for-beginners|Building bridges for beginners]]''', the procedure is basically the same but for underground.
And you cannot choose what type of tunnel you will build, they are all the same!
