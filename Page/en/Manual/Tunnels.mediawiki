[[Translation:en/Manual/Tunnels]]
Tunnels are useful for going under things you cannot move, or things that are too exepensive to remote, like large mountains for example. They can also be used in [[en/Community/Junctionary/Main Page]] in place of [[en/Community/Junctionary/Main Page]]. One thing you should keep in mind about tunnels is that vehicules of any speed can pass through them without slowing down, as is often necessary with [[en/Manual/Bridges]].
