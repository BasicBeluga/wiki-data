Tunnels are useful for going under things you cannot move, or things that are too expensive to remove, like large mountains for example. You can't build a bridge over cities, stations, diagonal tracks or industries, but you can tunnel under them.

They can also be used in [[en/Community/Junctionary/Main Page]]s in place of [[en/Manual/Bridges]]. Vehicles can pass through them without slowing down, unlike with some [[en/Manual/Bridges]].

==Building tunnels==
You can dig tunnels for roads and railways.  Bear in mind that you can't change between road and rail in a tunnel without rebuilding the tunnel (although you can change between different types of rail).
*Click on railway build button [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m772c5b23.png]] or road build button [[File:en/Manual/Manual html ma6d6c8c.png]] on the [[en/Manual/Game interface|menu bar]]. Once clicked the railway construction or road construction  toolbar pops up.

*Click on the tunnel button: railway [[File:en/Manual/Build traintunnel.png]] or road [[File:en/Manual/Build roadtunnel.png]]

In this tutorial we will focus on railway tunnels, but don't worry: constructing a road tunnel is the same!

*Move the cursor around the map to find a good spot for a tunnel. You can't dig a tunnel on a flat land, only one tile will be highlighted.

*Move the cursor over a slope and you can see the path of the tunnel you are about to build.

To build the tunnel, just click on the sloped tile.

==Advanced Tunnel building==

If you want to tunnel somewhere that does not have the correct slopes in the right place, you will have to either raise or lower land to make them right.

If there is a slope in an odd direction at the end of the tunnel, it will be automatically lowered so that the tunnel can be dug. However, you can't start digging the tunnel at such a slope; you must terraform it first.

[[File:en/Manual/Tunnel built second.png|none|frame|The slope will be automatically lowered in order to dig a tunnel]]

Sometimes, the odd directed slope can't be lowered automatically because of obstacles on surrounding tiles. You will see an error window saying so.

[[File:en/Manual/Tunnel error third.png|none|frame|The error message appears]]

Raise the land manually, so the tunnel end tile is a flat slope.
