I've been thinking about what I wanetd to know when I started playing my first MMO just 4 months ago.  When I stepped on the beach for the first time my first instinct was fear because I didn't know what was going to happen.  In Korthos I was afraid of the other players.  So I soloed.  My questions were  how do I  types.  But the fun was in the discoveries and working things out.  I don't want every question answered (except formulas for that stone of changing).  But if I get really stuck somewhere it is wonderful to find DDO Source.  I'm much less afraid of anything now and look forward to your guide to see what I missed.
