OpenTTD does not have an in-game Tutorial itself, but there exists a [[en/Game Script]] called ''Beginner Tutorial'' in [[en/Manual/Online content|Online Content]] which provides an interactive tutorial. Note that to run Game Scripts, you need at least OpenTTD 1.2.0.

=== How to get and start the Tutorial ===
# Click on play scenario (in the main menu)

# Close the download window
# Select the "beginner tutorial" in the Load Scenario window.

== Tutorial AI ==
A previous attempt to create a in-game tutorial was TutorialAI that used the AI framework. This AI shows step by step instructions on how to eg. build a bus connection.

This tutorial works also with OpenTTD 1.1.x.
