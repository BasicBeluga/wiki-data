Welcome to the OpenTTD general gameplay tutorial. Here you will be shown how to start a game and set up bus and train routes.  This will probably take around 15 minutes.  If you get stuck, right click on buttons in the game for a description of what they do.  The menu to the right shows more detailed tutorials on particular aspects of the game that you may like to investigate if there is something specific you want to learn about.

==Starting the game==
Open OpenTTD by double clicking the icon on your desktop. You will be presented with the main menu. 

[[File:en/GameMenu053.png]]

#Click the '''New Game''' button. This will open the World Generation screen, filled with even more dazzling options. Leave these to their defaults for now.
#Click the big green '''Generate''' button. The game will now create a new world for you to play in, and the game will start.

==Inside the game==
The screen you now see is what you'll be playing all of OpenTTD in. In the middle you can see the green landscape, perhaps with an industry, town or forest here and there. This is the world you'll be taming using the tools of your trade: roads, railways, docks and airports. 

At the top of the screen you'll notice a menu bar. Right click some of the buttons - a popup will appear to tell you about what the button does. Some of the buttons have menus under them. You can access the menu options by holding down the left mouse button, moving down the menu and releasing on the option you want.

==Setting up a bus service==
Let's build one of the simplest types of transport available to you; a passenger transport service by road (otherwise known as a bus). 
===Finding a suitable location===
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial bus 1.png|thumb|300px|right|A town]]
Click and drag using the right mouse button to move around around the map. Look for a group of houses - this is a [[en/Manual/Towns]]. Each town has its name displayed in the middle of it, followed by a number in brackets indicating its population. Try to find a town of 500 inhabitants or greater.

===Building bus stations===
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial bus 2.png|frame|right|Selecting a location and orientation]]
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial bus 4.png|thumb|300px|right|After building both bus stations]]
#Click on the ''Road construction'' button. A new toolbar appear with more buttons. These buttons are all related to building road-based services. 
#Click on the ''Build Bus Station'' button (the little blue building). The ''Bus Station Orientation'' window will appear, giving you four choices for the orientation of your bus station. 
#Look for a free tile next to a road, near to some houses. 
#Click the correct orientation button so that your bus station will have its entrance facing the road.
#Left-click on your chosen tile to build the bus station there. You'll notice a red number floating up, which indicates the amount of money you just spent. If you get the orientation right, you'll also notice the road is extended into your bus station.
#Repeat this procedure for another bus station in a different part of town.

===Buying a bus===
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial bus 5.png|thumb|300px|right|Inside the depot...]]
To move passengers between these two stations you obviously need to have a bus. [[en/Manual/Base Set/Road Vehicles/Buses]] (and all other vehicles) are built in [[en/Manual/Depots]].
#Build a road vehicle depot by clicking the ''Depot'' button in the ''Road construction menu'', and follow the same procedure as with the bus stations. Try to build it close to either of the bus stations but it doesn't matter if it's not surrounded by houses this time.
#Click on your newly built depot. The depot menu will appear, and you will get an overview of all the vehicles in there - currently none. We can change that by building a bus!
#Choose the ''New Vehicles'' button at the bottom of the depot. Another screen will open, this time listing all the vehicles available to you at this moment. At the top you will find the bus - an ''MPS Regal'' bus to be precise. 
#Click the bus to selected and then click ''Build Vehicle''. A new vehicle window will appear.

===Giving orders to your bus===
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial bus 6.png|thumb|300px|right|Giving orders]]
#In the vehicle window, click the ''Orders'' button (marked red in the screenshot to the right). 
#Click the ''Go To'' button, and then click on your first bus station with the special go to cursor. This will add an instruction to the vehicle's orders; ''Go to <station name>''. 
#Click ''Go To'' again, and add your second station to the vehicles order list in the same way. Once a vehicle has reached the end of its instructions, it will start over from the beginning.
#In the vehicle window, press the ''status bar'' at the bottom that says ''Stopped'', and your bus will leave the depot and start driving between the stations.

Congratulations - you have just built your first bus service! Over time passengers will gather at the bus stations, and your bus will collect them and drop them off at the other side of town. When this happens, you'll notice green numbers floating out of your bus - income!

Your bus will probably not be very profitable, as it drives only a short distance and will not carry very many passengers. You will need to create more transport services in order to build your income and empire.

==Setting up a train route==
{{en/Todo|Check the grammar}}
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial1.png|thumb|right|300px|Power station with nearby coal mine]]
Trains are faster and have a higher capacity, but they are more expensive than road vehicles and train networks require more planning than roads.

The most profitable [[en/Manual/Cargo|goods type]] in OpenTTD is coal. Coal to Power Stations is the biggest money maker. 

*Scroll around the map by until you find a [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Coal Mine]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Power Station]] in close proximity.

Now you have your industries, but how to get the coal to the power station?  Lets use a train, as they can hold lots of coal, and are probably the most fun vehicle.

===Building train stations===
[[File:en/Manual/Railroad Construction.png|frame|right|Railroad Construction toolbar]]
*Open the Railway Toolbar by clicking on the icon that resembles railway track, next to the Road Construction button.
{{en/-}}
[[File:en/Manual/Stationgui.png|frame|right|Train station selection window]]
*Click on the button with a picture of a station building. You will be given a new station building GUI.
*Right click on the buttons to get descriptions of each button.
*Set the "Number of Tracks" set to one, and the "Platform Length" at three. Select the best orientation for your station.

[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial2.png|thumb|right|300px|Your stations next to industries]]
*Find some flat ground next to the Coal Mine and place the station. 
*Build another station next to the power plant.

===Connecting train stations===
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial3.png|thumb|300px|right|Connected stations]]
Now you need to build track between the stations. 
*Connect the stations with rail by using the track buttons in the Railroad construction toolbar.  Play around laying track until you have a good track.
*Use the Dynamite button to remove misplaced track.

===Buying a train===
[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial4.png|thumb|right|300px|The depot window.]]
*Using the railway toolbar, select the Build Depot icon. A new window will open. 
*Place the train depot the same way as the road depot, facing a straight piece of track near the coal mine station. 
*Click on the depot and on the "New Vehicles" button, as with the bus.

*Click on a locomotive from the top of the list, then click '''Buy Vehicle'''. A train window will open. 
*Scroll down in the new vehicles window and buy '''six''' coal wagons.  Argh! I meant five! 
*Delete a wagon by dragging it to the "no-train" icon and then let go. 


Follow '''[[en/Manual/Buying trains]]''' for a more detailed tutorial.

===Ordering your train where to go===
*Assign orders to the train the same way you did with the bus, with one addition:
*In the orders list, click on the name of the coal mine station, and click the "Full Load" button. This tells the train to wait until it is full of coal.
*Click the "Stopped" button at the bottom of the train window to start the train!

Congratulations! You've built your first railway!  After the train loads and delivers the coal, you will notice that it makes much more money than the bus!

This is the simplest type of railway in the game, and can handle only 1 train.  After playing for a while you will learn how to make more complicated railways that have many trains.

==Conclusion==
So... you have set up your first transport services. What now? Well.. It's up to you!  You can choose to build a thousand bus services all across the map, rename your company to GreyHounds-R-Us and live happily ever after. Or you could see a nice business opportunity related to a forest and a nearby sawmill. Or perhaps a subsidy is offered for shipping oil to a refinery, which makes for a profitable deal. Who knows? Just make sure you keep your company running profitably, and perhaps you'll end up as the greatest Transport Tycoon in the year 2050.
