[[Translation:en/Manual/Tutorial/Two Tracks]]
When using a single track for multiple trains between two stations, it may happen that a train must wait for a long time before it can use the track, especially when the track is long.
The reason is that only one train is allowed on a single block of tracks to prevent train collisions.

To solve this, you can split your long single track into several pieces, as shown below.

The long single track between both stations is partly doubled. Trains going to the energy plant travel on the bottom line, and trains traveling towards the mine use the top line. In this way, trains can pass each other.

The signals on the double track are all one direction only.
