When you open a vehicle list you will be presented with something like this (1.). The top part of the window allows you to sort the list, the middle part is the list, and the button on the bottom lets you build new vehicles of that type.

==Sorting the list==

You can sort the vehicle list by the following criteria:
:*Number
:*Name
:*Age
:*Profit this year
:*Profit last year
:*Total capacity per cargo type
:*Reliability
:*Maximum speed
:*Model
:*Value (sum of values of all carriages)

You can then list them in ascending or descending order by clicking the ''"Sort by"'' button.

==Vehicle status==

The colour of the vehicle number and the circle tell you a lot about the vehicle.
:*If the vehicle number is blue the vehicle is in a depot.
:*If the vehicle number is red the vehicle is getting old and should be replaced.

:*If the circle is grey the vehicle is less than two years old.
:*If the circle is green the vehicles profit was more than £10,000 ($20,000) last year.
:*If the circle is yellow the vehicles profit was less than £10,000 ($20,000), but more than £/$0 last year.
:*If the circle is red the vehicles profit was £/$0 last year.
