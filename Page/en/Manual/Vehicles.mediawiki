[[Translation:en/Manual/Vehicles]]
In OpenTTD, '''vehicles''' are what keep your company moving. They produce your only source of income, and therefore must be deployed on a map to ensure success for your [[en/Manual/Transport company]]. Built in [[en/Manual/Depots]], your vehicles will follow [[en/Manual/Orders]] between [[en/Manual/Stations]], and will pickup any available cargo that they are able to carry. (Passenger trains do not pickup mail, for example, unless you add a mail van). There are four different types of vehicle in OpenTTD, each representing the major transport methods. They are as follows:

== Vehicle Types ==
:*[[File:en/Manual/Manual html m16a497ce.png|Trains]] [[en/Manual/Trains]]
:*[[File:en/Manual/Manual html m3518e48c.png|Road Vehicles]] [[en/Manual/Road vehicles]]
:*[[File:en/Manual/Manual html 53123a33.png|Ships]] [[en/Manual/Ships]]
:*[[File:en/Manual/Manual html 442702e6.png|Aircraft]] [[en/Manual/Aircraft]]

Each method of transportation has its own strengths and weaknesses:
*Ships carry a lot, but are slow and have high maintenance costs.
*Aircraft make a lot of money, but airports require a lot of space, and large airports are needed to handle many planes.
*Road Vehicles can move easily around towns and cities, but carry and make little money per trip.
*Trains can carry any amount and travel fast, but infrastructure requires a lot of space, and advanced planning is needed for high capacity networks.

Each vehicle has a different reliability rating, which is related to the number of [[en/Archive/Manual/Breakdowns]] the vehicle can suffer. 

However, despite the weaknesses of these vehicle types, it is possible to become rich in the game via any type.
