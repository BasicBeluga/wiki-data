When you want to transport large amounts of cargo or when industries are located in the middle of the sea (Oil Rigs for example) you may need to use water transport, even if it is quite slow.
==Constructing Docks==
You can start constructing by pressing the docks build button [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m2cc0c4cd.png]] on the [[en/Manual/Game interface|menu bar]]. Once clicked the Docks Construction toolbar pops up.

==What do all those buttons do?==
The buttons are self-explanatory. From left to right:<br>
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build dock.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Water Transport Tiles|dock]] button'''
:*[[File:en/Manual/Build dockdepot.png]] '''Build [[en/Manual/Depots|depot]] button'''
:*[[File:en/Manual/Place buoy.png]] '''Place [[en/Manual/Water Transport Tiles|buoy]] button'''
:*[[File:en/Manual/Clear title.png]] '''[[en/Manual/Landscaping|Clear land]] button'''
:*[[File:en/Manual/Lower land.png]] '''[[en/Manual/Landscaping|Lower land]] button'''

==Building Docks==
You can only build a [[en/Manual/Water Transport Tiles|dock]] at a slope that is connected to a water tile. This can be both at sea level, or as a part of a canal.

==Building Aqueducts==
{{en/Nightly}}
Aqueducts are like bridges, but for ships. Unlike road or rail bridges, they can not be built with a sloped bridge head, only levelled. The two sloped tiles inbetween which you want to construct an aqueduct also have to be in the correct direction, as the aqueduct, like normal canal tiles, can not be built using foundations.

==Building Ships==
To build a [[en/Manual/Ships]], place a ship [[en/Manual/Depots]] and then click it. You will be presented with the depot window. Select "Build new vehicles". A new window should pop up with a list of different ships to purchase. Select one you think will be necessary, and then press "Buy Vehicle" at the bottom of this window. The ship will then appear in one of the slots in the depot window and a window will pop up. Give it orders or refit it as necessary, and then click on the red "Stopped" text to start it!

==Operating ships==
In order to make your ships operate properly, your dock must be directly near, for instance, an oil refinery, so that oil can be offloaded directly. You can however also use an intermediary train station to transfer the oil. In that case, you must build a train station near the dock, and make sure your ships unload at the dock and leave empty. This can be achieved by selecting the dock destination in the orders list of the ship, and then clicking 'unload' and 'transfer'. The oil will then be transferred at the dock (at a profit) so your ships do not become unprofitable. Trains can then retrieve the oil to bring it to a factory.
