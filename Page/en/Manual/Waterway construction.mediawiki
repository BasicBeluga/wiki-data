When you want to transport large amounts of cargo or when industries are located in the middle of the sea (Oil Rigs for example) you may need to use water transport, even if it is quite slow.
==Constructing Docks==
You can start constructing by pressing the docks build button [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m2cc0c4cd.png]] on the [[en/Manual/Game interface|menu bar]]. Once clicked the Docks Construction toolbar pops up.

To build a [[en/Manual/Ships]], place a ship [[en/Manual/Depots]] and then click it. You will be presented with the depot window. Select "Build new vehicles". A new window should pop up with a list of different ships to purchase. Select one you think will be necessary, and then press "Buy Vehicle" at the bottom of this window. The ship will then appear in one of the slots in the depot window and a window will pop up. Give it orders or refit it as necessary, and then click on the red "Stopped" text to start it!
