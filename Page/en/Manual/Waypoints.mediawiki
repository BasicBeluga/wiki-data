[[Translation:en/Manual/Waypoints]]
When having a complex train network, your trains might not use the routes you want them to use. Checkpoints are the solution for this problem.

== Situations to use checkpoints ==

* Routing trains through a certain track
* Make certain trains use a specific platform on a station
* detouring trains to relieve heavy traffic routes

Checkpoints force the trains to go through a certain track, thus giving the player more control over his vehicles. 


== How to use checkpoints ==

# Build the rail track
# Choose the checkpoint button from the [[en/Manual/Railway construction]] toolbar
# Click on the rail track to build the checkpoint here<br>Note: This only works on straight rail tracks
# Now you can add the checkpoint to you train's schedule by [[en/Manual/Orders]]<br>The checkpoint will appear in the schedule with the text "Go via Checkpoint ..."
