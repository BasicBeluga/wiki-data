[[Translation:en/Manual/Waypoints]]
Train drivers in OpenTTD are not always as intelligent as real-world ones. You can make them go through checkpoints to ensure they're taking the correct route.
== Situations to use checkpoints ==

* Routing trains through a certain track.
* Make certain trains use a specific platform on a station.
* Detouring trains to relieve heavy traffic routes.

Checkpoints force the trains to go through a certain track, thus giving the player more control over their vehicles. 


== How to use checkpoints ==

# Build some track.
# Choose the checkpoint button from the [[en/Manual/Railway construction]] toolbar.
# Click on a straight piece of track where you want to build the checkpoint.
# Now you can add the checkpoint to you train's schedule by [[en/Manual/Orders]]<br>Checkpoints appear in schedules prefixed with 'Go via Checkpoint ...'
