[[Translation:en/Manual/Waypoints]]
Train drivers in OpenTTD are not always as intelligent as real-world ones. As in TTDPatch, you can make them go through waypoints to ensure they're taking the correct route.
== Situations to use waypoints ==

* Routing trains through a certain track.
* Make certain trains use a specific platform on a station.
* Detouring trains to relieve heavy traffic routes.

Waypoints force the trains to go through a certain track, giving the player more control over their vehicles.

== How to build and schedule waypoints ==

# Build your route.
# Choose the waypoints button from the [[en/Manual/Railway construction]] toolbar.
# Click on a straight piece of track where you want to build the waypoint.
# Now you can add the waypoint to your train's schedule by [[en/Manual/Orders]]<br>Waypoints appear in schedules, prefixed with 'Go via Waypoint ...'
