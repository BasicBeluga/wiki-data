[[en/Manual/Vehicles]] '''Breakdowns''' occur when a vehicle is in transit. It usually cause a vehicle to stop for a while, causing traffic buildup, but planes will only get a speed reduction which lasts until its speed drops below 6 mph/9 kmh.

The amount of breakdowns that occur to a vehicle is directly related to its reliability rating and age. It can be reduced by regular [[en/Manual/Servicing]] of vehicles at a depot or hangar.

In case of road vehicles, a breakdown can trigger the [[en/Manual/Disasters|Small UFO Disaster]], where an UFO will crash into a broken down road vehicle.

Breakdowns can be turned on or off via the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Difficulty|Difficulty window]].
