Whereas in the Temperate and Sub-Arctic [[en/Manual/Climates]]s '''water''' is easy enough to come by as rain, in sub-tropical regions it is somewhat harder to obtain.  These areas must have it shipped in as a commodity via your transport links.  That is, it needs to be collected from a [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Water Supply]] and delivered to a [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Water Tower]] where it will be fed into a town's water mains.
