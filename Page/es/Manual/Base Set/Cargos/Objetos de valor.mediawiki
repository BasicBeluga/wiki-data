Jewelery and gold stored in the safes of banks, valuables are exchanged between banks. They are paid most, but are also very rare since there are few banks providing few valuables to be transported.

Valuables can only be found in the [[en/Manual/Climates#temperate|temperate climate]].

Note that before OpenTTD 1.0/r17437 transporting valuables a distance of less than 10 tiles yields no money.
