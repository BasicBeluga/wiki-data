Gold is a mineral used by the banks to backup the currency. It is extracted (and perhaps smelted, who can tell?)  in the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Gold Mine]] and stored or coined in the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Bank]].

Gold can only be found in the [[en/Manual/Climates#sub-arctic|Sub-artic climate]].
