hahahaha holy chamoly! That's quite the encreiexpe.You will definitely be more savvy from now on with your interactions with the Chinese. Man It's almost like a heads up for me when I finally make the trek there. I think it's hilarious though that you had your shoes shined so many times. This is great material for a memoir of sorts ;0D Not gonna lie it probably would have been SUPER awkward to ride on a bike for that long with a random stranger. Wow I can't even imagine. You're right though all of this sounds straight out of a movie or a book. Good times! Hope the sun shines brighter on you from now on!
