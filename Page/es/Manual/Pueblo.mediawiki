Las '''Ciudades''' es donde los habitantes de OpenTTD viven. Cada ciudad tiene una población que puede crecer o disminuir dependiendo de ciertas condiciones..

==Edificios==
Los [[es/Archive/Manual/Edificio|edificios]] de las ciudades son una fuente de [[es/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Pasajeros|pasajeros]] y [[es/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Correo|correo]], que pueden ser transportados a otras ciudades o dentro de la misma ciudad.

En algunos casos los edificios también podrán aceptar otros cargamentos, como ''Mercancías'' o ''Alimentos''. Para que una estación pueda aceptar estos cargamentos, debe haber un total al menos de 8/8 casillas con edificios que acepten este tipo de carga dentro su ''área de alcance''. Utilice la herramienta [[es/Información sobre el terreno|Información sobre el terreno]] ([[File:en/Manual/Manual html 51cda05b.png]]) para conocer el tipo de carga que acepta cada edificio individualmente.

La población de la ciudad se calcula en función del número de edificios y cuántos habitantes tiene cada edificio.

==Industrias==

{{en/Pending translation/Es)}}

Certain Industries locate within towns:
* the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Bank]] can be found in towns with populations of over 1200.
* the Water Tower found in desert towns in the Sub-Tropical climate.

==Town Growth==
The population of towns can increase, providing more passengers/mail to transport.

Towns grow in two ways: 
* existing buildings are demolished by the town and replaced by larger buildings.  You might notice the town population temporarily dips while the new building is constructed.
* the town constructs new buildings on empty tiles next to town roads.

Sometimes new buildings will increase the number of cargos accepted in a town (such as Goods).

Over time towns will grow very slowly even if no service is provided; however players can influence town growth in several ways.

===General Conditions for Town Growth===
Town growth can be accelerated by loading and unloading at least one item of cargo at five stations within town influence within a two month period.  It does not matter which cargos are loaded/unloaded.

Towns will expand physically by extending roads onto empty areas of the map, then constructing new buildings next to the new roads.  Roads can't be built over diagonal train tracks or tracks with signals on, so be careful not to hem your towns in completely when building your transport empire.

===Climate-Related Conditions for Town Growth===
====Temperate, Toyland====
There are no special conditions for a Temperate or Toyland town to grow.  Simply load/unload cargo as described above.

====Sub Arctic====
If centre square of the town is above the snow level, at least 1t of food per month must be delivered for the town to grow rapidly.  The town information window will show the amount of food delivered recently.

The towns will grow very slowly on their own, so in the case of small towns not large enough to accept food, it is simply a case of waiting for them to grow. As with any other cargo a station needs at least 8/8 of food acceptance in its coverage area before it accepts food.

The amount of food delivered has no effect on the rate of town growth.

If the centre square is not above the snow line food is not required for growth, although food will be accepted. 

====Sub Tropical==== 
If the centre square of the town is in the desert, at least 1t of [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Food]] and 1t of [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Water]] per month must be delivered for the town to grow.  The town information window will show the amount of food and water delivered recently.

The towns will grow very slowly on their own, so in the case of small towns not large enough to accept food, it is simply a case of waiting for them to grow. As with any other cargo a station needs at least 8/8 of food acceptance in its coverage area before it accepts food.

[[File:en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Water tower.gif|right]]
Water must be delivered to a Water Tower industry. Water Towers may be generated automatically in towns, or a player may choose to fund one using the "Fund new industry" menu.

The amount of food and water delivered has no effect on the rate of town growth.

If the centre square is not in the desert food and water are not required for growth, although Water Towers may still exist in the town and food/water will be accepted. 

===Tips for Town Growth===
In the Temperate climate, a simple bus service can drastically increase the population of a town. It is sensible to connect not-too-distant small towns together with bus services to bulk-up their population before a train station or airport becomes viable. Alternatively, creating a bus route within a larger town can produce an even higher rate of growth. 

* A bus with one passenger from the other side of town would have the same effect on growth as a large train full of passengers from the other end of the map.  
* A town with a feeder station where cargo is picked up but not set down will also grow.
* The cargo "Goods" '''does not''' affect town growth in any climate.
* A player can choose "Fund New Buildings" from the Local Authority window.  This may result in rapid population growth for a short time, or increase acceptance of cargos such as Goods.
* Players can try and ensure towns are not hemmed in by train tracks, airports, water etc.
* Extending roads for a town may slightly increase the chance of new buildings being constructed successfully.  If the town has plenty of empty roads this is unlikely to have an effect.

==Cities==
A city is a special form of town that will grow twice as fast as a regular town. A city is also larger to begin with. There are two settings that affect cities: ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Economy#proportion-of-towns-that-will-become-cities|Proportion of towns that will become cities]]'' and ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Economy#initial-city-size-multiplier|Initial city size multiplier]]''.

==Towns' Local Authority==
Each town is managed by a [[en/Manual/Local authority]] that determines which actions a [[en/Manual/Transport company]] may take in or near each town. Clearing trees  (including those cleared by landscaping or bulldozing) and destroying town's industries, buildings, roads, tunnels and bridges all lower the company rating in the town. However, planting trees, successful bribes and providing services to the town (stations that has transferred cargo in the last 50 days) increases the company rating. To place a station, the company must have a minimum rating of -200 (Poor).

Use the [[en/Manual/Land area information]] tool to find out which local authority a tile belongs to (if any).

==Towns and NewGRFs==
Town buildings can be modified and/or replaced by NewGRF sets.  NewGRF sets are available offering a range of changes, from adding just a building or two, up to total town replacement.  NewGRF sets can also redefine which cargos are accepted and produced by town buildings.  NewGRF sets can also provide new or modified industries which locate in or near towns.

==Magic Bulldozer Cheat==
If the [[en/Manual/Cheats#magic-bulldozer|Magic bulldozer]] cheat is enabled, there is a risk that an expanding town can accidentally demolish an industry. The safe way to use this cheat is to enable it, do what you need to do with it, and then remember to turn it off again. The risk comes about if you leave it active after you are done using it which can then lead to towns demolishing industries.
