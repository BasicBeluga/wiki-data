==Trains lents/rapides==
Les trains lents bloquant les trains rapides sont une perte de temps ainsi que d'argent.  Heureusement, il existe des stratégies pour éviter cela.  En voilà une:

A train coming from the green line will reserve the path first (using [[en/Manual/Signals]]), so the one on the red will have to wait. However, if the train on the red arrives soon enough and reserves the path first, the one on the green will take the track at the top with the signal, to make sure it does not have to completely stop long before the junction. The length of that piece of track depends on the length and speed of your trains.

Also you may use just simple block signals, but as One-way tracks, use Path Signals for Two-ways

==Electric Train on Non-electric Track==

Electric Trains on Non-electric Track, how? Very simple, there is an Electric Main Line, but if you wish to get your train to go to a Non-electric Station and not wish to build a separate train, here is what you do, you connect a diesel engine to the back of your train, or use an engine on battery available in some Newgrf Train Sets, of course it can pick-up about 99km/h (61.52 mph).
