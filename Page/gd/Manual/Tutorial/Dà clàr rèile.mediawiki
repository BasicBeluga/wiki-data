== Dà chlàr rèile ==
Nise on a tha thu air a' chiad rèile agad a thogail, dh'fhaoidte gu bheil thu airson a leudachadh le barrachd thrèanaichean is chlàran.

On [[gd/Manual/Tutorial/Main Page|oideachadh roimhe]], bu chòir do rathad-iarainn a bhith agad  a tha coltach ris na chì thu san dealbh gu h-ìosal.
{{en/Phototable|[[File:gd/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial single track.png|400px]]|Dà stèisean, slighe-iarainn is trèan (briog air gus a mheudachadh)|none}}

Tha sinn a' cleachdadh an eisimpleir seo oir tha an dà stèisean faisg gu leòr gus an cur san aon dealbh. Sa gheama agad fhèin, 's dòcha gu bheil slighe mòran nas fhaide ann, is faodaidh tu na clàran agad a chur ann air dòigh eile.

=== Cuir clàr eile ris ===
'S e an duilgheadas leis a' cho-dhealbhachd gu h-àrd nach tèid na slighean is na steiseanan a chleachdadh gu èifeachdach. Tha thu a' pàigheadh uiread dhe dh'airgid gus na slighean uile seo a ghlèidheadh is cha chleachd ach aon trèan iad! Ma nì a' mhèinn guail gual gu leòr, 's dòcha gum b' fheairrde thu trèan a bharrachd a chur ris. Nuair a bhios trèan an làthair an-còmhnaidh gus gual a luchdadh, gheibh an stèisean agad rangachadh nas fhearr is thèid barrachd dhe na nì an gnìomhachas a lìbhrigeadh dhan stèisean agadsa. Mar as motha dheth 's ann nas fhearr, nach e?

Mus urrainn dhut trèan a bharrachd a chur ris, tha rum a dhìth air san stèisean ri taobh na mèinne guail. San dòigh seo, fhad 's a bhios an dàrna trèan a' luchdadh, 's urrainn dhan trèan eile a dhol dhan stèisean-cumhachd gus dì-luchdadh is tilleadh. Nuair a bhios an trèan air tilleadh, 's urrainn dhan dàrna trèan a dhol ann is dì-luchdadh fhad 's a bhios an trèan eile a' luchdadh a-rithist.

Bu chòir do [[gd/Manual/Tutorial/Trèanaichean|chuimhne a bhith agad]] air mar a thogas tu stèisean is rathad-iarainn. Siuthad, tog clàr eile ri taobh a' chlàir tùsail aig an stèisean ri taobh na mèinne guail. Cho fad 's a bhios an clàr ùr ri taobh an stèisein tùsail, thèid a chur ris an stèisean seo. Cuideachd, tog slighe gus an clàr ùr a cheangal ris an rathad-iarainn a tha ann. Nuair a nì thu seo, dèan cinnteach gu bheil pìos dìreach air beulaibh gach clàir oir bidh an rum seo a dhìth oirnn nas fhaide air adhart gus comharran a thogail orra. Dèan cinnteach gun gabh an dà chlàr a ruigsinn on trèan-lann. Faodaidh tu an trèan-lann tùsail a spreadhadh leis an inneal “boma” ma tha i san rathad is tè ùr a thogail àiteigin eile.

=== Cur comharran ris ===

Before you can run the second train you need to make sure that it doesn't collide with your existing train. Signals prevent trains from crashing into each other, so we need a couple of those things.

Click the [[File:en/Manual/Place signal.png]] '''Build Railway Signals''' button from the railway constuction toolbar. This will open the '''Signal Selection''' toolbar.

''OpenTTD knows six different types of signals. Fortunately, two of these six signal types can be used over 95% of the time. These signals are called [[en/Manual/Signals]] and are by far the easiest to use. For now, you can just ignore the other four signal types. If you already looked at the signal selection window, you may have noticed not six but twelve signal buttons. The upper six are semaphore signals and do exactly the same as their lower six light signal counterparts. The semaphores just look different and give your track a more classical look. For the tutorial, we'll only be using light signals as they are more easy to distinguish. You're free to use either in your games.''

{{en/Phototable|[[File:gd/Manual/Yapp signalgui.png]]|Path signals|left}} The path signals are marked in the image of the signal selection toolbar at the left. The leftmost of the two path signals is the so-called two-way path signal. Trains can pass this signal from both sides, but will only obey the signal if the train driver can 'see' the light from the front. The rightmost with the horizontal red bar is the one-way path signal. It behaves the same as its two-way counterpart, but trains can only pass it from one side (the front).

These path signals are smart signals, as they consider the route a train wants to take. As soon as a train encounters a path signal, it will "reserve" its route to the next signal. A second train will be allowed on the same junction as long as its route (or path, hence path signals) does not cross the reservation of other trains on the junction. If it needs to cross a reserved path, it will wait at the signal until it can make its own reservation. Having that said, there's one important rule to keep in mind: only place signals where you want a train to be able to wait. We'll be looking into this in more detail later. If you cannot follow this reservation business right now, just continue and do the same things as done in the images.

Now select the [[File:en/Manual/Signal Electric Path.png]] '''two-way path signal'''. Click the first piece of track in front of the platform to build the signal there. Make sure the signal faces the platform; you may need to click the tile a second time to turn the signal around. Repeat this for the other platform.

Do you need a signal in front of the depot as well, you ask? No, depots have built-in signals, so there's no need for that. Elsewhere you also may have read that you don't even need path signals in front of stations. While that is true to some extent for terminus stations, it isn't for through stations. If you're new to OpenTTD signalling, it's recommended to place signals in front of terminus stations anyways. Besides that it looks better, you can easily make a terminus into a through station without forgetting to add the signals and having to ask why it doesn't work.

=== Adding another train ===
Now everything is ready to add the second train. Click the depot to open the depot window. One way to purchase the second train is exactly the same way as you've purchased your first train. However, if you want the second train to be identical to the first train, including its orders, click the '''Clone Train''' button at the bottom of the depot window. Next, click the first train. An identical copy of the first train (including orders) will be placed in the depot and now you only have to start it.

In addition to this, if you hold the Control button on the keyboard while clicking on the first train to clone it, the orders of both trains will be ''shared''. This means that when you change the orders of one of the two trains, the orders of the other train will be changed automatically as well. Might be useful in the future.

Now you have two trains on the same route. Good job!
You may have noticed that some parts of the tracks in the screenshot above have a darker colour. This is a feature to show each train's path reservation. Now this feature is disabled by default, but you can enable it from the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings]] > Interface > Display options > Show reserved tracks.
