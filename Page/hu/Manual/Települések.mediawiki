Az OpenTTD lakosai '''városokban''' élnek.

Az [[en/Hu/Épület|épületek]] a városokban [[en/Hu/Utas|utasokat]], és [[en/Hu/Levél|levelet]] termelnek, melyeket el lehet szállítani más városokba, vagy ugyanabba a városba. A nagyobb épületek nagyobb számú utasokat, és leveleket termelnek, ezért a város központjában elhelyezett állomások növelik az utasok számát. A kivétel a raktár, mely nem termel utasokat, és levelet, hanem teljes mértékben elfogadja az árukat.

A nagyobb épületek részben tudnak árut fogadni mérsékelt, szub-arktikus, és szub-trópusi éghajlaton. Szub-arktikus és szub-trópusi éghajlaton elfogadnak ételt is. Étel és áru szállítása segíti a város növekedését.

Egyes iparágak jelen vannak a városokban, ilyen a [[en/Hu/Bank|bank]], mely csak akkor található meg a városokban, ha azoknak a népessége 1200 fő fölé nőtt, és a víztorony, mely a sivatagi városokban található meg, szub-trópusi éghajlaton. Víz és étel szállítása feltétlenül szükséges a sivatagi városoknak a növekedéshez!

Ha a [[en/Hu/Csalások#csodabuldozer|csodabuldózer]] csalás be van kapcsolva, fennáll a veszélye annak, hogy a város véletlenül lerombol egy ipari létesítményt, miközben terjeszkedik.

== Towns' Local Authority ==
Each town is managed by a [[en/Manual/Local authority]] who determine which actions a [[en/Manual/Transport company]] may take in each town. Clearing trees  (including those cleared by landscaping or bulldozing) and destroying town's industries, buildings, roads, tunnels and bridges all lower the company rating in the town. However, planting trees, successful bribes and providing services to the town (stations that has transferred cargo in the last 50 days) increases the company rating. To place a station, the company must have a minimum rating of -200 (Poor).

==Growth==
Towns require passenger transportation to grow, although they grow slowly without any help. Goods and food can increase the rate of growth where accepted, and water is necessary for desert towns.
 
A simple bus service can drastically increase the population of a town. It is sensible to connect not-too-distant small towns together with bus services to bulk-up their population before a train station or airport becomes viable. Alternatively, creating a bus route within a larger town can produce an even higher rate of growth. 

In short, the growth of a town is heavily dependent on the number of passengers picked up ''and'' delivered, regardless of origin. A bus-full of passengers from the other side of town has the same effect on growth as one carriage of passengers from the other end of the map. A town with a feeder station where passengers are picked up but not set down will also grow.

Towns grow by extending roads into empty areas of the board, then building next to the new roads.  Roads can't be built over diagonal train tracks or tracks with signals on, so be careful not to hem your towns in completely when building your transport empire.

==Cities==
A city is a special form of town that will grow twice as fast as a regular town. A city is also larger to begin with. There are two settings that affect cities: ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Economy#proportion-of-towns-that-will-become-cities|Proportion of towns that will become cities]]'' and ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Economy#initial-city-size-multiplier|Initial city size multiplier]]''.

==Climate-related Conditions==
===Temperate===
There are no conditions for a Temperate town to grow, unlike the Sub-Arctic and Sub-Tropical climates so a mere passenger service will suffice. [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Goods]] can accelerate the growth of a town, although it is the number of [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Passengers]] delivered to the town which has the most impact.

===Sub Arctic===
Towns where the centre square is above the snow level need monthly food supplies to grow. Although there is no requirement for the level of food to induce growth, the rate of expansion can be increased slightly by increasing the food supply.

The towns grow very slowly on their own, although food must be delivered for a passenger service to have an impact. In the case of small towns not large enough to accept food, it is simply a case of waiting for them to grow slowly on their own. As with any other cargo a station needs at least 8/8 of food acceptance in its coverage area before it accepts food. Use the [[en/Manual/Land area information]] tool to find out about the acceptance of individual houses.

===Sub Tropical=== 
Any town where the centre square is in the desert requires [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Food]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Water]] to grow. Non-desert towns require neither food nor water.

Water must be delivered to a Water Tower, not straight to ordinary buildings as they obviously do not accept water in the form of large tankers. Water Towers may be generated automatically, else they must be built by the player. Any amount of water delivered to a town satisfies the need for water for that month. Excessive water supply does not increase the rate of growth, unlike food. Regarding small towns the same rules as for the Sub Arctic climate apply.

===Toyland===
Toyland is similar to the Temperate Climate, where there are no requirements for growth. [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Toys]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Sweets]] (the equivalent of Goods and Food respectively) can help to accelerate the growth of a town.
