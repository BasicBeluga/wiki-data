==Quattro vie a quattro tracce ==
Una versione estesa del [[it/Community/Junctionary/Quadrifoglio|nodo quadrifoglio]] per le linee principali tracciate in stile AABB (che indica la direzione dei treni che lo percorrono).
Questo incrocio utilizza tunnel invece di ponti, perché i tunnel non hanno limiti di velocità.
Come puoi vedere dall'immagine qui sotto, ci sono due tracce che conducono allo svincolo e due che portano fuori: l'unico scopo del doppio quadrifoglio è di permettere che più traffico scorra attraverso la tua linea, se hai una linea principale a 4 tracce.

===Pros===
* Double tracked, holds twice the number of trains
* Can handle a large number of trains at the same time.
* Uses separate tracks so trains wont interfere with each other too much.

===Cons===
* Branching after merging: Very likely to enter a deadlock state.
* Extremely large
* Trains have to slow down when climbing a slope
* Trains have to turn right to turn left. This could lead to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed using [[en/Manual/Waypoints]])
* Doesn't have a direct path so that trains travel extra far to turn left.
* Costly to build
* Difficult layout to remember and to build

===Variations===

== 6-way 2-track Double Overlap Clover ==
Taking two cloverleaf junctions and overlapping them together produces a 6-way junction. This is similar to the 4W4T clover, except that the mainline is signalled ABAB-style rather than AABB (train direction per track) and that trains can change over (an expensive operation the path finder tries to generally avoid).

It has the same extent as the Clover-in-Clover (24×24). Without the direct right turns, the extent shrinks to a compact box of 20×12.

== 8-way 2-track Quad Overlap Clover ==
Taking four cloverleaf junctions and overlapping them together produces an 8-way junction. (Again, if one ignores the space, it is a 4-way 4-track interchangeeven though the double tracks are separated by a void of 6 squares, combining them likewise, an 8-way junction can be obtained. This is similar to the 4W4T cloverleaf in that, when one considers the two 2-tracks , and handy when the mainline tracks are signalled ABAB style (indicating direction trains run in) rather than AABB.
