OpenTTD에서는 게임 플레이에 많은 영향을 끼치는 많은 설정들을 변경할 수 있다. 많은 설정들은 '설정' (1.4.4 이전에서는 고급 설정) 창에서 변경할 수 있지만, 몇몇 옵션들을 변경하기 위해서는 [[ko/Openttd.cfg|openttd.cfg]] 라는 설정 파일을 변경해야 한다. [[ko/NewGRF|NewGRF]]를 설치함으로서 옵션을 늘릴 수도 있다. 대부분의 설정 항목은 [[ko/Manual/게임 인터페이스|인터페이스]] 혹은 게임 내 권력에 영향을 준다.

The '''Advanced Settings''' window allows you to change most of the available settings from within the game. The Advanced Settings window has a tree-like structure, divided up into the following main sections:

*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Interface|Interface]]
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Construction|Construction]]
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|Vehicles]]
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Stations|Stations]]
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Economy|Economy]]
*[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Competitors|Competitors]]

Buttons are green to show the setting is on, red to show it is off. Arrow buttons change the value of the setting like a horizontal scrollbox. Clicking on a patch-line with arrow buttons shown will bring up an edit box, where the desired value can be typed in.

There are three "levels" of settings, the *basic*, the *intermediate* and the *expert* level, which each successively adds more settings to the game which in turn need a deeper understanding of how they affect gameplay.

== Changing settings in a running game ==
If you access advanced settings from the main menu, that affects new games only. If you want to change advanced settings of a running game, load it first and then change the settings you want to change.

==History==
Some features that have been advanced settings (patches) in older versions of OpenTTD can now be found under [[en/Manual/Game options window|game options]] or [[en/Manual/Cheats]]. Some of them might even have become permanent features that you cannot disable.{{en/-}}

The Advanced Settings windows was previously (prior to OpenTTD 0.7.x) known as the ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Configuring patches|Configure Patches]] window''. This name came from [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/TTDPatch]] and was used in OpenTTD as well for quite some time.

Prior to r14275, the "Advanced Settings" were called ''Patches''. This was dropped in favour of "Advanced Settings" in order to avoid confusion with TTDPatch in general, or patches (in the technical sense) against the source code of OpenTTD often found in the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=33 Development section of tt-forums].

Since r14974 the tabs at the top of the window are removed and all advanced settings are listed in a tree structure. This allows for subcategories that can be expanded and collapsed independently. The former tabs (''Interface'', ''Construction'', ''Vehicles'', ''Stations'', ''Economy'' and ''Competitors'') are now top level categories and they can now have subcategories, for example the subcategory ''Trains'' in ''Vehicles''.
