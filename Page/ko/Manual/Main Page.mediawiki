[http://www.openttd.org/ '''OpenTTD'''] 또는 '''오픈 트랜스포트 타이쿤'''은 크리스 소여가 개발하고 [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroProse 마이크로프로즈]사가 유통을 담당했던 게임인 [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Tycoon 트랜스포트 타이쿤 (TTD)]를 분석하여 [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open source 오픈 소스]로 새로 만든 경영 시뮬레이션 게임이다. 이 게임은 플레이어가 1950년에 한 운송 회사의 사장으로 시작하여 철도, 도로, 항공, 해운 수송 경로를 골라 자신만의 운송 대국을 만드는 게임이며 다른 경쟁사를 이기며 승객들을 자기 회사로 끌어들여 2050년에 가장 높은 순위의 운송 회사가 되는 것이 목적이다.

OpenTTD는 [http://www.chrissawyer.com/info.htm 크리스 소여의 트랜스포트 타이쿤 디럭스]를 기반으로 하고 있지만, 멀티 플레이 지원, 향상된 역과 차량, 더 큰 지도와 고급 옵션 등을 포함한 새로운 기능을 많이 도입하였다. OpenTTD는 리눅스, 유닉스, BeOS, OS/2, 윈도와 다른 몇몇 [[en/Archive/Compilation and Ports/Operating system|운영체제]]에서 실행할 수 있다.

==특징==
:[[File:en/Searchtool.png|16px]] ''관련 게시물: [[en/Archive/Lists/List of New Features|새로운 기능]]''

다른 게임이 후속작을 내놓을 때 기존 작품의 특징 모방하려고 하는 반면, OpenTTD는 여러 가지 많은 기능을 추가하여 게임을 극적으로 개선하였다. OpenTTD는 사용자가 커스터마이징할 수 있는 게임 그래픽을 가지고 있으며, 이를 이용해 현재 TTD의 그래픽을 완전히 대체하는 프로젝트가 진행 중이다. 많은 기능이 TTD의 기능 향상판으로 인기를 받았던 [http://www.ttdpatch.net/ TTDPatch]에서 영향을 받은 것이다. OpenTTD는 [[en/Adcanced Settings|고급 설정]]과 [[en/Manual/NewGRF|사용자 그래픽]]을 통해 트랜스포트 타이쿤 디럭스보다 더 많은 커스터마이징이 가능하다.

Significant enhancements include the introduction of [[en/Manual/Multiplayer]], railways tracks built with the [[en/Archive/Manual/Autorail]] tool and [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|on slopes]], [[en/Manual/Waypoints]], trains that are [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Mammoth trains|longer]] with [[en/Archive/Manual/Multiheaded trains|more engines]] and larger and more realistic maps. More advanced players can take advantage of [[en/Manual/Signals]] for more control over stations and junctions, an increase in the number of allowed vehicles, and [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Nonuniform stations|more flexibility]] when it comes to stations.

To make the game more enjoyable, [[en/Archive/Manual/Yet Another Pathfinder|new train pathfinders]] have been added to let trains find their way better, a [[en/Manual/Convert rail|convert rail]] tool to make upgrading easier and a [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Extra dynamite|bigger dynamite tool]] to make blowing things up a lot faster.

There are many more features that are present in OpenTTD, and more are added all the time. For a complete list of new features, go to the [[en/Archive/Lists/List of New Features]].

==History of Transport Tycoon==
The first Transport Tycoon (TT) game was released in 1994. It was developed by Chris Sawyer and released by MicroProse. 
It was very popular at the time. Compared to many other games of the time, it was spectacular. The intuitive gameplay and the colourful, crisp graphics, combined with endless opportunities to build and shape the transport network of your dreams made it a winner.
With the release of Transport Tycoon Deluxe (TTD) in 1995, the game was greatly improved. Many new features, including 4 different environments, maglev trains, one-way signals, etc, were implemented.
TTD continued to be played for many years after by a small, but fanatic bunch of gamers. Even though the game had been fairly successful, no direct sequel was announced. Chris Sawyer's Locomotion can be considered as successor, but could not connect to the previous success.

===The rise of TTDPatch===
Somewhere around 1996-1997, Josef Drexler started a project called TTDPatch, which was (as the name implies) a patch for TTD. Originally it only did small things, but later on it was able to support [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] files, two company colours, and even trams. It fixes some problems with the game and also adds a lot of new features to it. The TTDPatch project has endured for many years and has changed the game quite radically.

===A Windows version===
A great problem during 1996 was that TTD had been written in assembly language and was not especially portable. Nevertheless, a Windows 95 conversion was made by FISH Technology Group in 1996, but it was only released by Microprose (later Hasbro Interactive) in 1999, in a Tycoon compilation known as "The Tycoon Collection", including Railroad Tycoon 2, Rollercoaster Tycoon, and Transport Tycoon Deluxe. This Windows version introduced a few bugs, including broken tutorials, and had a FISH UK logo added to the startup screens (removed from OpenTTD).

===Enter OpenTTD===
''The Patch's'' method of modifying the game made a lot of potential features near-impossible. [[en/Archive/Community/Users/Ludde]] contacted Owen Rudge, owner of [http://www.tt-forums.net/ TT-Forums], in 2003, and explained he was going to reverse engineer the game and convert TTD to [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/C (programming language) C]. A year later Ludde surprisingly presented Owen Rudge with the first [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software release life cycle release]. Forums were created where people discussed the new incarnation of the game. Response was positive, and other developers joined Ludde in the project. Work continues on OpenTTD to this day. 

===OpenTTD 1.0.0===
At the end of 2009 an important milestone was reached. Up till this time graphics and sound files from Transport Tycoon Deluxe were required to play OpenTTD but now free and open alternatives, [[en/Archive/Community/OpenGFX Readme]], [[en/Archive/Community/Sound Effects Replacement]] and [[en/Archive/Community/OpenMSX]], are also available and supported. These large community contributions made OpenTTD a fully stand-alone game for the first time and to mark this occasion this release was given the version number 1.0.0.
