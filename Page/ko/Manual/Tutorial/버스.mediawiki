==버스 서비스 제공하기==
가장 간단한 종류인 도로로 승객을 수송하는 운송 시스템 하나를 만들어보도록 하겠습니다. 바로 버스입니다.

===적절한 장소 찾기===
마우스 오른쪽 버튼을 누른 채로 마우스를 드래그하여 지도를 살펴보십시오. 집이 모여있는 곳이 있을텐데 그것이 바로 [[ko/도시|도시]]입니다. 각 도시는 중앙에 도시의 이름이 표시되며, 그 옆에 인구 수를 나타내는 숫자가 괄호로 표시되어 나타납니다. 500명 이상의 인구를 가진 도시를 찾아보세요.

===버스 정류장 건설하기===
#''도로 건설'' 버튼 [[File:en/Manual/Roadcnstr.png]]을 누르세요. 더 많은 버튼이 있는 새로운 창이 나타날 것입니다. 이 버튼은 도로 건설과 관련된 버튼입니다.
#''버스 정류장 건설 버튼'' [[File:en/Manual/BsStp.png]]을 누르세요. 그러면 ''버스 정류장 방향''이라는 창이 나타나는데, 버스 정류장을 지을 방향을 선택할 수 있게 해줍니다. 왼쪽의 4개는 끝이 막혀있고 도로 바로 옆에다 짓는 터미널식 버스 터미널입니다. 오른쪽의 2개는 도로 위에 건설하는 통과식 버스 정류장입니다.

<ol start="3">
<li>Look for a free tile next to a road, near to some houses. 
<li>Click the correct orientation button so that your bus station will have its entrance facing the road.
<li>Left-click on your chosen tile to build the bus station there. You'll notice a red number floating up, which indicates the amount of money you just spent. If you get the orientation right, you'll also notice the road is extended into your bus station.
<li>Repeat this procedure for another bus station in a different part of the town.
</ol>

===Buying a bus===
To move passengers between these two stations you obviously need to have a bus. [[en/Manual/Base Set/Road Vehicles/Buses]] (and all other vehicles) are built in [[en/Manual/Depots]].
#Build a road vehicle depot by clicking the ''Depot'' button [[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/RVDPT.png]] in the ''Road construction toolbar'', and follow the same procedure as with the bus stations. Try to build it close to either of the bus stations but it doesn't matter if it's not surrounded by houses this time.
#Click on your newly built depot. The depot menu will appear, and you will get an overview of all the vehicles in there - currently none. We can change that by buying a bus!
#Choose the ''New Vehicles'' button at the bottom of the depot. Another screen will open, this time listing all the vehicles available to you at this moment. At the top you will find the bus - an ''MPS Regal'' bus to be precise.
{{en/Phototable|[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial bus 5.png]]|Inside the depot...|none|6=:}}
<ol start="4">
<li>Click the bus to select it and then click ''Buy Vehicle''. A new vehicle window will appear.
<li>Now your bus is built and ready to take orders. You don't need the ''Depot'' window anymore for now, so click on the x in its top-left corner.
</ol>

===Giving orders to your bus===
#In the vehicle window, click the ''Orders'' button [[File:en/Manual/Orders.png]]. 
#Click the ''Go To'' button, and then click on your first bus station with the special go to cursor. This will add an instruction to the vehicle's orders; ''Go to <station name>''. 
#Click ''Go To'' again, and add your second station to the vehicles order list in the same way. Once a vehicle has reached the end of its instructions, it will start over from the beginning.

<ol start="4">
<li>In the vehicle window, press the ''status bar'' at the bottom that says ''Stopped'', and your bus will leave the depot and start driving between the stations.
</ol>

Congratulations - you have just built your first bus service! Over time passengers will gather at the bus stations, and your bus will collect them and drop them off at the other side of town. When this happens, you'll notice green numbers floating out of your bus - income!

Your bus will probably not be very profitable, as it drives only a short distance and won't carry a lot of passengers. You will need to create more transport services in order to build your income and empire.
