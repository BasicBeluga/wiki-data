'''철도 역'''은 모든 철도 네트워크의 핵심 구성 여소입니다. 철도역에서는 [[ko/열차|열차]]에 모든 종류의 화물을 싣거나 내릴 수 있습니다. 만약 철도 네트워크를 만드려고 한다면, 철도역을 본선에서 분리시켜서 본선에 지연을 유발시키는 필요없는 트래픽을 만들지 않는 것이 좋습니다.


==기본 형태==
아래의 역 형태들은 짓기 쉬우며 몇 안되는 [[ko/열차|열차]]들이 운행될 때 적절한 결과를 보여줄 것입니다. 만약 통행량이 증가했을 때에는 [[ko/Manual/철도 역#gogeub-hyeongtae|고급 역사 형태]]를 시도해 보는 것이 좋습니다.

===두단식 역===
아래 철도 역들은 철도 노선의 끝 부분에 위치합니다. 열차는 들어온 방향으로 되돌아나가게 되며 역으로 들어가거나 나오는 열차에 의해 막히게 됩니다. 이 형식의 철도역은 작거나 단순한 청도역이나 Ro-Ro 방식의 역을 지을 만한 부지가 도저히 없을 때에 이용됩니다.
[[File:en/Manual/Terminus.png|center|frame|간단한 두단식 역 : 왼쪽 예시는 [[ko/Manual/신호기#pyesaeg-sinhogi|폐색 신호기]]를 이용하고 있고, 오른쪽 예시는 [[ko/Manual/신호기#gyeongro-sinhogi|경로 신호기]]를 사용하고 있습니다.]]

===Ro-Ro===
Ro-Ro는 Roll-On(들어가는 것), Roll-Off(나오는 것)을 의미합니다 (경우에 따라 Roll-In,Roll-Out이라고 답변해주는 경우도 있음). 열차는 아래의 역사 끝으로 들어가게 되고 나올 때에는 다른 끝으로 나오게 됩니다. 열차는 반대 방향에서 열차가 나올 때까지 대기할 필요가 없습니다. 이 형식은 중간 정도의 트래픽이 있는 역에 적당합니다. [[en/사전 신호기]] 없이는 높은 트래픽을 가지고 있는 역에는 적당하지 않습니다(예시 : 공장에 화물을 수송하는 역). 왜냐하면, 열차는 사전 신호기가 쓰이지 않는다면 두 입구 중 가까운 곳으로 가버리기 때문입니다. 이렇게 한다면 승강장이 모두 2차 생산물 수송 열차로 차고 1차 생산물이 들어올 수 없게 될 수 있기 때문에 데드락을 유발할 수 있습니다.
[[File:en/Manual/Ro-ro1.png|center|frame|2선의 Ro-Ro 철도역입니다. 왼쪽은 폐색 신호기, 오른쪽은 경로 신호기를 사용하고 있습니다. 오른쪽 예시에서는 열차가 두칸을 남겨놓고 대기하게 되지만, 제동 공간으로도 사용됩니다.<!--원문 보존.

===Drive-thru station===
A basic station which trains can either stop at or pass by. It includes waiting areas for trains departing or joining the main-line, note this is equal to the length of the station and assists in reducing or nullifying the slow-down caused by trains entering the station from the main-line as well as leaving space for trains to wait, without blocking the main-line, should all station slots in a given direction be occupied

[[File:en/Manual/Drive thru.png|center|frame]]

===Combined terminus- and roro-station===
It is also possible to build stations which serve both as terminus and roro-stations. However, the difficulty option "Train reversing" must be set to "At end of lines and at stations" in order for them to work. Trains can enter the station from both directions, and can leave in both directions, too.

While the setup using path signals will work very well, the one using block signals will lead to trains getting stuck. This will happen if two trains coming from opposite directions pass the entry-signal almost simultaneously and want to enter the same platform. The first train will be able to enter it, while the second train will be stuck in front of a red exit-signal. Therefore you should try to avoid the block-signal setup or only use it for stations with very low traffic.
[[File:en/Manual/Two-way-roro-station.png|center|frame|Combined terminus- and roro-station, the right one using block signals, the one at the left using path signals.]]

===Bag station===
If there is no space to build a rail from both ends of the station, but the station is not the end station, a bag station is useful too. Train will enter the station, turn around and then go out the station and continue in the original direction.

A bag station can not be built on a line with a heavy traffic because there can be only one train in each direction, and other trains have to wait before the station. This can be solved with the waiting bay, but it will not be good anymore. The trains have to slow down when entering or leaving the station too.
[[File:en/Manual/Polany.jpeg|center|frame|Bag station, original mainline is on the top.]]

==Advanced stations==
For larger train networks, the above stations probably won't be able to handle all of the trains assigned to them.  You will need more advanced track layouts and signals.

What happens when a third train arrives at one of the above stations? It sees both two-way signals are red, so it just picks the closest one and waits for the light to change. If the other platform empties while the third train is waiting, the platform will stay empty.

What about the queues that form as trains line up to enter a station?  These lines can stretch far, and can even hold up your entire train network!

===Pre-signals===
Stations with [[en/Manual/Signals#pre-signals|pre-signals]] make arriving trains wait outside the station until there is a free platform.
[[File:en/Manual/Presignalstation.png|center|frame|Pre-signal station]]

===Waiting bay===
A good solution to hold a queue of trains waiting to enter a station is a multi-line waiting bay.  If the station is full, an arriving train picks the closest empty track in the waiting bay.  When a spot opens in the station, one of the waiting trains will move in.  Make sure a train can fit between the signals.  The pre-signals are optional; they help if your waiting bay fills up too!
[[File:en/Manual/Waitingbay.png|center|frame|Waiting bay for up to 4 6-wagon trains]]

===Loop around===
Instead of using pre-signals, you can build a loop around track. When a train enters the station and sees all the two way signals are red (platforms are full) except the loop around track, it will take the loop around track. It loops around and around, waiting for a free platform. A problem with this system is other arriving trains can steal the free platform while the first train is looping around. Remember to make the loop big enough to fit at least your longest train.
[[File:en/Manual/Loop.png|center|frame|Loop for overflow control]]

===Escape depot===
Another way of controlling station overflow is an "escape depot." Place a depot in the two-way/one-way signal set up at the entrance. Depots automatically have a (traditional) bi-directional signal in them so behave just like a loop around track. Escape depots, unlike loops, have an unlimited capacity. 

The best layout has a depot at both ends of the station entrance. (This will reduce the time required to cross a large station)

[[File:en/Manual/Escapedepot.png|center|frame|Escape depots for overflow control (this example works only with pf.yapf.rail_firstred_twoway_eol set to true, which is not default setting anymore)]]

===Long exits===
Normally, when two trains leave a station at once, one must stop and give way to the other. This leaves one train half in the station and half out, making that platform unusable to any other trains trying to enter the station. Long exits allow the train to pull out of the station completely before it hits the red signal. This frees up the platform for another train entering the station. Note the length of the exit track, a 10-car train can fit neatly between the signals.
[[File:en/Manual/Longexit.png|center|frame|Long exits overflow control]]

===Long exits, prioritized===
Getting [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Mammoth trains]] to exit a busy Ro-Ro station in a timely fashion can be challenging. By using pre-signals you can prioritize station exit tracks to allow trains on faster tracks to depart sooner. In the image below a lower priority is assigned to the topmost 5 exits (since they'll block the return track longer) and the exit at the bottom (since trains accelerate slower on the sharp bend) by requiring them to wait upon the block exit pre-signal. They must wait for the exit signal to clear (that is, when a train passes the 2nd signal on the return track). The other tracks are not forced to do so and will depart when a train passes the 1st signal as usual. 
[[File:en/Manual/Priorityexit.png|center|frame|Long exits with priority signals]]

===Long entrances===
If you play with [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Realistic acceleration]], faster trains slow down a good bit before stopping in a station.  This can delay the next train from entering.  Adding a few track sections in front of the station can help with this.
[[File:en/Manual/Longentrance.png|center|frame|Long entrance for realistic acceleration patch]]

===Double entrance===
This is a type of design used for stations that handle a huge number of trains, such as the stations servicing factories or food processing plants. Trains coming from one place can use loading bays meant for other trains if need be.  Be sure to use pre-signals.
[[File:en/Manual/Doubleentrance.png|center|frame|Double entrance. Those 4 platforms are divided into 2 groups with each handling 1 entry track. The [[en/Manual/Signals#combo-signals|combo-signal]] inbetween the junctions allows the trains from both entries entering the platforms simultaneously without interfering each other, but reserving the way for trains to cross-over to the other group when no platform is available on its group.]]
[[File:en/Manual/DoubleEntrance2.png|center|frame|Faster double entrance, avoiding sharp bends (for trainlength <=5)]]
[[File:en/Manual/Screen shot 2012-03-24 at 7.08.39 AM.png|center|frame|You can also use path based signals. The top one allows the train to wait within the design, but trains can get stuck on one side if the other opens up, similar to when block signals are used when pre-signals are needed. For the bottom one, there is no reason to make it as long as your trains are, as they will wait at the PBS anyways. The design has been tweaked slightly to eliminate some sharp turns, so it's friendly to long trains, and is a great compromise between speed and size. It's also friendly with realistic acceleration; the area after the PBS acts as breaking space.]]

===Feeder bays===
If your rail network has large trains going long distances, it can be very cost effective to "feed" their loading station with more cargo from nearby industries.  Because the longer the distance the cargo travels, the more you get paid.  In the pictured station, there are 4 bays for small trains to transfer coal from nearby mines.  Large trains then deliver the coal to a far away power station. 

[[File:en/Manual/Feederstation.png|center|frame|Station with 4 feeders]]

===Prioritised drive-thru stations===

These stations are in the middle of a line and trains can pass them by without using up valuable platforms. Signalling makes a crucial difference here - you can give priority to the mainline trains or the stopping trains with them.

This station gives priority to trains leaving the station.
[[File:en/Manual/Station priority.png|center|thumb|700px|Priority to station]]

This station gives priority to trains passing the station by.
[[File:en/Manual/Mainline priority.png|center|thumb|700px|Priority to mainline. Changes are marked with red circle.]]

===Ro-Ro Terminus===
====Principle====
This style of station is a mix between the Ro-Ro and Terminus styles.  In essence, it takes a terminus station and makes it possible for a train to leave its platform without disrupting the traffic flow entering the station.  It can be used to upgrade a terminus style station and improve station efficiency.  Modifications upon this design could increase the number of platforms to handle a larger number of trains at once.  The example has been pre-signaled for greater efficiency. 
[[File:en/Manual/Alternative RoRoTerminus.png|center|frame|A mix between the Ro-Ro and the Terminus stations]]
This build allows trains to enter and exit station simultaneously. However, it takes a bit more space than ordinary terminus.

====Variations====

'''Note there is a one-way out signal under the bridge.''']]

[[File:en/Manual/Adv terminus 4tr.png|center|thumb|550px|Advanced 4 bay station. Note on the top one, the first signal on the right fork after the entry bridge is a combo signal.]]

[[File:ro/Manual/Ro.png|center|thumb|550px|Some variations of same idea]]

====Giant Ro-Ro terminus====

It's of course possible to increase the number of platforms of a Ro-Ro terminus station. You can go as far as you want as long as there's enough space.
[[File:en/Manual/Epicterminus.png|center|thumb|550px|Advanced 10 bay station]]

Below is a little more efficient design, with two tracks each sharing an entry and exit line. It consumes half as much space while nearly not decreasing the capacity. It is important that the directions are not switched: Else trains would have to climb up when entering the track, blocking the crossing unneccessarily long.
[[File:en/Manual/Sharedepicterminus.png|center|thumb|550px|Light advanced 10 bay station]]

Here bridges instead of tunnels
[[File:en/Manual/8 platform station.png|center|frame|A high-capacity Ro-Ro Terminus mix]]

Here is another high throughput Ro-ro station. The bridges are low quality concrete only to make them stand out visually. The left side uses bridges (obviously) and path based signaling. The right side uses tunnels and pre-signals.
[[File:en/Manual/High throughput Ro-ro station.png|center|frame]]

This station continues on that design, but with separate two pairs of separate entry/exit tracks.
[[File:en/Efficient Terminus.png|center|frame|An even higher capacity Ro-Ro Terminus mix]]

This is a huge Ro-Ro terminus for very busy lines. There are 2 tracks inbound, 2 tracks outbound and 4 train can enter and exit at the same time (2 enter and 2 exit).
[[File:en/Manual/Compact terminus.jpeg|center|frame|A very high-capacity Ro-Ro Terminus mix]]

===Advanced Combined Terminus- and Roro-Station===
As with a standard ro-ro station, trains enter at one end of station and exit on the other end, thus trains entering the station do not have to wait for trains leaving. This station is designed so that non-stop trains can pass through the station without unnecessarily blocking empty platforms from trains that need to stop at the station. It can serve as a terminus station without the need to reverse train direction. It includes escape depots so it can endure heavy traffic even if there is no space to add additional platforms. This station design is an efficient trade-off between the fast advanced terminus types and saving precious building space.

[[File:en/Manual/Advanced ro-ro terminus.png|center|thumb|550px|A 4 bay advanced combined terminus- and roro-station designed for heavy traffic in small building spaces.]]

===Roundabout station===
Can handle a huge amount of small trains.

[[File:en/Manual/Roundabout station.png|center|thumb|700px|A double roundabout station]]

==NewGRF Stations==
[[File:en/Manual/Newstationsgui.png|right]][[en/Manual/NewGRF]] Stations, or newstations, are available after you have activated a Newstations grf file. You will then have access to a new station-building GUI.

The new GUI has a drop down box of station groups. Each group has a number of station tiles to choose from. Select a station tile and it will be previewed in the orientation boxes. Some newstation tiles do not allow trains to enter for the effect of full buildings or buffer stops. Be aware when placing newstation tiles that some tiles do not allow more than so many tracks or squares. The numbers not allowed will be greyed out and you cannot build this size. Some newstations sets offer more visual effects than others. For example, in Michael Blunck's newstations, passengers will gather on station platforms as the waiting cargo increases. 

If the station set contains newgrf waypoints, the Waypoint GUI will open upon selecting it. You will have full previews of every waypoint possible for you to build. Most waypoints have introduction and obsoletion dates, in which waypoint styles will be replaced by newer versions. However, any waypoints you have already built will not automatically changed, allowing for variation on your networks. 

Newstations behave the same as normal stations; the only difference is the non-track tiles that block trains.
