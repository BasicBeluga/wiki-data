==기차의 경로 설정하기==
기차는 버스같은 운송수단보다 빠르고 많은 용량을 운반할 수 있습니다. 그러나 더 비싸고 기차망을 연결하기 위해 더 많은 계획이 필요합니다. 

OpenTTD에는 몇몇 종류의 운송 수단[[en/Manual/Cargo]]과 산업[[en/Manual/Industries]] 연결이 있습니다. 가장 단순하지만 수익성이 높은 것은 석탄 [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Coal]]을 석탄 광산[[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Coal Mine]]에서 에너지 발전소[[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Power Station]]로 보내는 경로입니다. 그러므로 우리는 이러한 경로를 설정해 볼 것입니다.

OpenTTD의 세상을 이해하기 위해서는 여러분들은 이 게임이 항상 남쪽에서 바라보는 정사각형의 격자판을 기본으로 하고 있다는 사실을 알아야 합니다. 가상 환경에서 OpenTTD의 모든 것들은 북서-남동 혹은 남서-북동 축의 격자판을 따라 정렬되어 있습니다. 여기에 위배되는 몇 안되는 예외로 기차 선로의 높낮이가 있는데 이것은 수평 방향 혹은 수직 방향을 향할 수 있습니다. 하지만, 버스역, 언덕의 경사, 다리나 터널들은 여전히 격자판을 따라 놓여집니다.  

===Locating your route===
Scroll around the map until you find a [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Coal Mine]] and a [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Power Station]] in close proximity.  For this tutorial it doesn't matter too much about how far apart they are, but the further you transport cargo the more income it generates so in a real game you won't want to pick them ''too'' close.
{{en/Phototable|[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial1.png|400px]]|Power station with nearby coal mine.|none}}

Now you have found some industries but we need a way to get the coal to the power station.  We'll use a train, since this is the trains part of the tutorial, and besides they can hold lots of coal and are probably the most fun vehicle. 

===Building train stations===
{{en/Phototable|[[File:en/Manual/Railroad Construction.png]]|Railway Construction toolbar.|none|6=:}}
#Open the ''Railway Construction'' toolbar by clicking the [[File:en/Manual/RailCnstr.png]] button.
#Click on the ''Build railroad station'' button [[File:en/Manual/RailSt.png]]. A station building window will appear. Remember, you can right click on any button if you ever want a description of what it does.
{{en/Phototable|[[File:en/Manual/Stationgui.png]]|Train station selection window.|none|6=:}}
<ol start="3">
<li>Set the ''Number of Tracks'' to one, and the ''Platform Length'' to three. Each "unit" will take two carriages so in a real game, you choose the length of your station according to the length of the trains you want to load there, i.e. a station of 3 squares long will take one locomotive and five carriages.
<li>Select the best orientation for your station so that you can run the track in the right direction between the industries.
<li>Find some ground next to the Coal Mine.  It must be flat and clear of obstacles except trees for an area of at least the number of squares long your station will be (in this case 3 squares) and for the orientation you have chosen for your station.  If you are having trouble finding ground flat and clear of obstacles, try the other orientation for the station, or a little further away from the coal mine: but not too far, otherwise you won't be able to pick coal up!    
<li>Click to place the station.  
<li>Build another station next to the power plant.  Again, you need the site to be flat and clear of obstacles for a long enough area along on one of the grid lines.
</ol>
{{en/Phototable|[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial2.png|400px]]|Your stations next to industries.|none|6=:}}

===Connecting train stations===
Now you need to build the track between the stations. 

#Click the ''Autorail'' button [[File:en/Manual/Autorl.png]] on the ''Railway Construction'' toolbar.
#Drag in a straight line from one of the stations towards the other to lay the track.  
#Add more connecting sections until you reach the other station (you can build the track in the screenshot to the right using two drags of the autorail - one for the straight bit and another for the approach to the power station).
{{en/Phototable|[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial3.png|400px]]|Connected stations.|none|6=:}}

If you make a mistake you can use the ''dynamite'' [[File:en/Manual/Clear title.png]] tool to remove parts of the track.

===Adding a train===
Now you need to buy some trains, but you can't just have them magically appear on your tracks - you need to build a train [[en/Manual/Depots]].

#Click the ''Build train depot'' button [[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/TrnDpt.png]] on the ''Railway Construction'' toolbar. A new window will open giving you a choice of orientations. 
#Choose an orientation and place the depot so that the front entrance is facing onto some track, like in the screenshot. Make sure that both your chosen depot site and the adjacent track are on flat ground. Connecting rails will automatically be added so your trains can enter and leave the depot.
#Click on your newly built depot. The depot menu will appear, and you will get an overview of all the trains in there - currently none.
{{en/Phototable|[[File:en/Manual/Tutorial/Tutorial4.png|400px]]|The depot window|none|6=:}}
<ol start="4">
<li>Choose the New Vehicles button at the bottom of the depot window. Another screen will open, this time listing all the vehicles available to you at this moment. Click on a locomotive from the top of the list, then click ''Buy Vehicle''. A train window will open.
<li>Scroll down in the new vehicles window and buy six coal wagons.  
<li>Whoops, actually I meant to say buy five - we'll have to delete one. Drag any wagon to this: [[File:en/Manual/SellTrainVehicle.png]] button and then let go - it will be sold back and you will get some money in return.
</ol>
''See [[en/Manual/Buying trains]] for a more detailed tutorial.''

===Giving orders===
#Assign orders to the train the same way you did with the bus in the earlier part of the tutorial.
#There are some extra options available for trains that we'll make use of. In the orders list, click on the name of the coal mine station, and click the ''Full Load'' button. This tells the train to wait until it is full of coal before it leaves the station.
#Click the "Stopped" button at the bottom of the train window to start the train.

Congratulations - you've built your first railway! After the train loads and delivers the coal, you will notice that it makes much more money than the bus.

This is the simplest type of railway in the game, and can handle only one train (try to add any more and you'll find they just stay in the depot).  After playing for a while and reading some of the other Railway tutorials, you will learn how to make more complicated railways that can hold multiple trains at the same time.
