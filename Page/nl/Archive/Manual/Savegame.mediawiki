Don't hate just on Activision for their marketing. It is all a metatr of suply and demand. They demand your supply or something like that   Remember EA has also jumped on the special features / extra money boat. How many course can you buy for Tiger Woods 12? If you buy a used EA game you still have to buy a $10 license to play online. It seems to me if game developers were serious about making money they would make all their products digital download only through Xbox Live, save money in production and sell it for a couple bucks less. Saving a couple bucks is just the same as making a couple bucks. My rant aside gaming is still a more cost effective hobby compared to golf.
