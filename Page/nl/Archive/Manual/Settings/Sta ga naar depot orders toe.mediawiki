'''Allow go to depot orders''' is a [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|setting]] that allows players to put a depot in a vehicle's [[en/Manual/Orders]]. 

== Description ==
[[File:fr/Archive/Manual/Settings/Go To Depot.png|right|frame|"Go to depot" order in the vehicle's order list]]
When enabled, this option lets you include a depot in a [[en/Manual/Orders|vehicle's orders]]. This is useful for compulsory servicing at a particular point in the orders (maybe before a complicated junction you definitely don't want a train breaking down at).

== How to use the go to depot order ==
You can just order the vehicle to go to a depot, like with a station, and the vehicle will visit that depot when it sees that order in its list before continuing, much like any other [[en/Manual/Waypoints]] or station in its orders. 

When you select a go to depot order in the order list, the "Full Load" and "Unload" instruction buttons in the order windows will respectively change to "Service" and "Refit" ones.

If you do not want that the vehicle will visit the depot every order list's cycle, use the ''Service'' instruction: the go to depot order is ignored if the servicing interval is not expired yet.

If you want the vehicle to be [[en/Manual/Refit|refitted]] at the depot, press the ''Refit'' instruction button. A pop-up window will appear showing the refit options for that vehicle.

== Use ==
This feature is enabled by default. You can disable this patch through the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles|Advanced Settings -> vehicles]] window or use the following syntax in [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:
<pre>[order]
gotodepot = false</pre>

== Caution ==

A vehicle with a go to depot order anywhere in its orders will ''never'' look for a depot on its own, regardless of the service interval set. So if you set one go to depot order, you become responsible for all of that vehicle's servicing.
