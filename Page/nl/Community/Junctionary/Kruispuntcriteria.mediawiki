==Kruispuntcriteria==
This is a list to clarify the usefulness of a junction. 
Every item is should be listed in all junctions as a pro or con.
Use this [[Template:en/Community/Junctionary/Junction Criteria|template]].

===Definitie van een kruispunt===
a junction where two or more railway lines meet or cross

==Attributen==

===Scherpste draai===
* Minimum afstand tussen dubbele bochten
* Zie [[nl/Community/Bochten|bochten]], [[nl/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#treinen|treinen]] (snelheden tabel)

===Kosten (ongeveer)===
* Approximate cost in dollars ($)

===Constructie moeilijkheid===
* Ease of memorizing
* How much time it will take



===Backup===
* Backup is when trains are waiting to enter the junction

===Doodlopend eind (Gridlock of Filevorming)===
* Deadlock is when a train can NOT exit the junction therefor causing a backup

===Elevatie (heuvels)===
* Trains go up or down hills while in the junction

===Tunnels=== 
* Junction uses tunnels.

===Bruggen===
* Junction uses bridges.

===Natural Turns=== 
* Trains turn left for left.
* (opposite) Trains must turn right to turn left. This could lead (although very rare) to trains getting lost. (Can be fixed by using [[en/Manual/Waypoints]])

===Splitsen voor samenvoegn===
* Whether or not tracks split before they merge. (This leads to less backup if they do.)

===Treinlengte (max of min)===
* Maximum or minimum length of a train

===Gebied===
* Width and Height represented as WxH

===Direct===
* A lane that goes straight through without any turns
* (Opposite) Indirect path

===Symmetrisch===
* In neither, one, or two axes

===U-bochten en Lussen===
* U-turns are fine as long as they do NOT loop around to them selves
* Roundabout is an exception due to its design style.

===Sein type===
* Original, Pre-Signal, or PBS.

===Deffecten===
* How any one broken down train will effect the junction
* From total shutdown to blocking one lane.

===Klassificatie===
* Single Line
** One track 
* Single Mainline
** One track each direction
* Dual Mainline
** Two tracks each direction
* Dual Isolated Mainline
** Two tracks each direction
** The inner and outer tracks do not merge at any point
