|Omschrijving=With two power cars, this [[en/Manual/Base Set/Monorail]] is brilliant for high-capacity passenger routes. It also looks very swish with a rake of monorail passenger carriages. When you have a long train, say, more than 8 cars, you will find the train never reaches top speed.  Join two sets together in a single train (4 power cars total) to hit top speed on the flat.
|Real-life=The Millennium Z1 train seems to resemble the German [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transrapid "Transrapid"] high speed monorail/maglev hybrid train in that both are high speed multiple units primarily aimed at passenger transit. Although [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/Transport Tycoon Deluxe]] only appeared in 1995, eerily enough, Transrapid came into commercial use, albeit in a limited form, in late 2004 - rather similar to its service date in game, and was in development when Transport Tycoon first appeared.
