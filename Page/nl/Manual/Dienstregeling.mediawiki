== Interface ==
Timetables were introduced in [[en/Archive/OpenTTD/OpenTTD 0.6.0]] (since beta 2). The timetable button is located on the right top of the orders window. All orders for the selected vehicle are displayed inside the Timetable window. You can choose how much time a vehicle should spend in a station (in days or cycles - configure via patches) and if you wish, how much time it should take the vehicle to travel between points of its route. There is a counter stating whether a vehicle is on time or whether a delay has occurred.
