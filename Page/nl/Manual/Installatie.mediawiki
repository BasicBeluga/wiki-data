=Introduction=
Since version 1.0.0 OpenTTD, installation is simplified enough, the game is a completely (play and graphics) on open source and are included in the installer. To download the latest version of OpenTTD [http://www.openttd.org/download-stable click here].

Installation can be a little complicated, as the [[en/Archive/Community/Base graphics]] are not distributed with the game. So beside [http://www.openttd.org/ downloading the game], you need to obtain a set of base graphics as well.

Currently, there are two sets of base graphics that OpenTTD can use:
* One fully functional set is located on the [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport Tycoon Transport Tycoon Deluxe] (TTD) CD. As opposed to OpenTTD, TTD is '''not''' freeware;
* An [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open source Open Source] alternative to the TTD base graphics called [[en/Archive/Community/OpenGFX Readme]] is currently finished. The OpenGFX base graphics set is for those guys not having the original TTD CD.

Also, there are different versions for different [[en/Platforms]] (Windows, MacOSX, Linux).

= Files from TTD=
If you're installing OpenTTD with the TTD base graphics, OpenTTD requires several original game files from your Transport Tycoon Deluxe installation CD.

The following files are mandatory. You need to copy them to the /data directory, which is in your OpenTTD directory. These files contain the graphics and the sound effects:
* trg1r.grf
* trgcr.grf
* trghr.grf
* trgir.grf
* trgtr.grf
* sample.cat


Additionally, you may want to copy the original game music. To accomplish that, you need to copy the /gm/ folder from the TTD CD to your OpenTTD directory (don't put it in the data/ dir!).


There are a few ways to get these files:
* Copy the folder and files from the TTD game CD to your OpenTTD /data folder.
* Unzip a TTD installation zip file, and copy the folders.
* Install TTD for Windows in another directory and then copy the folders.
