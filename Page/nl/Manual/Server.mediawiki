'''1''' From the Main Menu, click '''Multiplayer'''

'''2''' Click '''Start Server'''

'''3''' Pick a name for your game to help others identify it, and enter it into the '''Game name''' box

'''4''' Configure the additional settings, explained below:

'''5''' Click '''New Game''' (to generate random new game), or '''Load Game''' (to continue an saved game), or '''Play Scenario''', or '''Play Heightmap''', or '''Cancel'''.

==Settings==
*'''Set Password''' sets a password for the server so that only users who know the password can join your game.
*'''Connection''' specifies whether the server is for LAN use only, or if it advertises itself to the master server so that it shows up in the internet server list.
*'''Language Spoken''' is for requesting that users speak a certain language on your server.
*'''Max clients''' limits the total number of clients (players and spectators) that can connect.
*'''Max companies''' limits the number of companies at game.
*'''Max spectators''' limits the number of clients who can connect to watch but not play (not-players).

==Ports==
If your computer is behind a firewall or [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation NAT] router, you should check that the correct [[en/Manual/Port]]s (port 3979 by default) are open or forwarded.
You can change the port used by entering "server_port <port>" into the game's console.

==Dedicated server==
If you are expecting many players and aren't going to be using the machine yourself to play, you can start OpenTTD as a [[en/Manual/Dedicated server]] instead of the usual interactive graphical version.
