In OpenTTD, '''vehicles''' are what keep your company moving. They produce your only source of income, and therefore must be deployed on a map to ensure success for your [[en/Manual/Transport company]]. Built in [[en/Manual/Depots]], your vehicles will follow [[en/Manual/Orders]] between [[en/Manual/Stations]], and will pickup any available cargo that they are able to carry. (Passenger trains do not pickup mail, for example, unless you add a mail van). There are four different types of vehicle in OpenTTD, each representing the major transport methods. They are as follows:

== Voertuigentypes ==
:*[[File:en/Manual/Manual html m16a497ce.png|Trains]] [[nl/Manual/Treinen|Treinen]]
:*[[File:en/Manual/Manual html m3518e48c.png|Road Vehicles]] [[nl/Manual/Wegvoertuigen|Wegvoertuigen]]
:*[[File:en/Manual/Manual html 53123a33.png|Ships]] [[nl/Manual/Schepen|Schepen]]
:*[[File:en/Manual/Manual html 442702e6.png|Aircraft]] [[nl/Manual/Vliegtuigen|Vliegtuigen]]

Each method of transportation has its own strengths and weaknesses:
*Ships have a large fixed capacity, but move slowly and have high initial costs.
*Aircraft make a lot of money, but airports require a lot of space, and large airports are needed to handle many planes.
*Road Vehicles can move easily around towns and cities, but carry and make little money per trip.
*Trains can carry any amount and travel fast, and are usually cheapest in the long-term. But infrastructure requires a lot of space, and advanced planning is needed for high capacity networks.

Each vehicle has a different reliability rating, which is related to the number of [[en/Archive/Manual/Breakdowns]] the vehicle can suffer. Vehicles are occasionally offered to your company as an exclusive prototype; these prototype versions will have lower reliability than the final release a year later.

It is possible to become rich in the game via any type of vehicle, given an appropriate environment. Over vast distances planes and trains perform well and for small ones where huge amounts of cargo needs to be delivered, ships become a good solution (for example, oil rigs). Ships are inappropriate for very long trips because of time penalty. See [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Cargo income]] for details on income calculations.
