The trucks and buses are the "small fry" [[en/Manual/Vehicles]] of OpenTTD. Useful for passenger and cargo transport where space is scarce (e.g. big cities), but prepare to build a whole lot of them. The vehicle names were changed in TTD to avoid trademark infringements, and OpenTTD retains the made-up names. You can change them back by downloading and activating the "Original Vehicle Names" NewGRF.

Buses are basically trucks carrying people. However, they need [[en/Manual/Loading Bays#bus-loading-bay|bus stations]] instead of [[en/Manual/Loading Bays#lorry-loading-bay|loading bays]].

==Accidents==
Road vehicles will not crash on their own, even at heavily congested stations and depots.  

However they can be destroyed by collision with trains so you should be careful where you build level crossings.  Although the lights on a crossing will flash and stop any approaching road vehicles when a train is coming, if a vehicle is already on the crossing and the train is moving quickly, the road vehicle will not be able to leave the crossing in time and will be crushed.  The train will continue undamaged.

A malicious player can deliberately cross several squares of road with railway tracks and use 1 train to create a massive traffic jam and use trains either side of it to deliberately crush the vehicles.
