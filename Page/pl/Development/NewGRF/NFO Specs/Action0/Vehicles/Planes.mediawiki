== Descriptions ==

=== Primary (0F) and secondary (11) cargo capacity ===
Aircraft can transport up to two cargo types.
The first (primary) cargo type can be changed when refitting the aircraft.

The secondary cargo type is always mail, and is only present when the primary cargo type is part of the [[en/Action0/Cargos#cargoclasses-16|passenger cargo class]].

See also the page about [[en/VehicleRefitting|vehicle refitting]].

=== Sound effect (12) ===

The following sound effects are used by planes (note, the setting is ignored for helicopters):

{| |-
!Number!!Sound
|-
|06||Propeller sound 1
|-
|07||Jet sound 1
|-
|3B||Supersonic
|-
|3D||Jet sound 2
|-
|45||Propeller sound 2
|-
|46||Jet sound 3
|}

{{en/Ottdp|1.6|no|ottdrev=r27507}} Since OpenTTD r27507 also custom sound effects from Action11 are allowed here.

=== Callbacks (14) ===
For planes, the following [[en/Callbacks]] have to be enabled by setting the corresponding bit in property 14 (certain other, not as frequently used callbacks are available without setting a bit here)::

{| |-
!Bit!!Value!!Variable 0C value!!Callback
|-
|2||4||12||Load amount
|-
|3||8||15||Set refitted capacity
|-
|5||20||19||show a suffix after the cargo type name
|-
|6||40||2D||Select color mapping for vehicle
|-
|7||80||33||Sound effect callbacks
|}

Bit is the bit you have to set, you do this by adding all the values for all the bits. Variable 0C value is what variable 0C will be set to, for checking it in the VarAction2 for callbacks.

=== Refit cost (15) ===

Refit cost, using 1/32 of the default refit cost base. This property can be overridden by callback 15E.

{{en/Ottdp|1.2|no|ottdrev=r23087}} If the refit cost factor is set to zero and bit 4 of the miscellaneous flags (17) is set, auto-refitting is allowed.

=== Miscellaneous flags (17) ===

This is a bit mask, with the following bits:

{| |-
!Bit!!Value!!Meaning
|-
|0||1||reserved, do not use
|-
|1||2||Uses two company colors
|-
|2||4||reserved, do not use
|-
|3||8||reserved, do not use
|-
|4||10||{{en/Ottdp|1.2|no|ottdrev=r23087}} Auto-refitting is enabled for refits where callback 15E allows it or prop 15 specifies zero cost.
|-
|5||20||{{en/Ottdp|1.2|no|ottdrev=r23861}} Use cargo multiplier for default cargo. See page about [[en/VehicleRefitting#misc-vehicle-flag-5-use-of-capacity-multiplier-for-default-cargo-set|vehicle refitting]].
|-
|6||40||{{en/Ottdp|1.3|no|ottdrev=r24124}} Disable breakdown smoke effect.
|-
|7||   80||{{en/Ottdp|1.7|no|ottdrev=r27668}} [[en/Action2/Vehicles#composing-vehicles-from-multiple-sprites|Compose vehicle from multiple sprites.]]
Note: This also applies to the rotor sprite, if custom rotor sprites are used.
|}

=== Long format introduction date (1A) ===

Set the vehicle introduction date, in days since the year 0. This takes account of leap years; dividable by 4, but not 100 unless 400. A start date of 1920-01-01 is obtained with a value of 701265 (51 B3 0A 00). This property must be set after property 00 to take effect.

{{en/Ottdp|no|}} In TTDPatch, dates after 2044 will be limited to 2044.

=== Sort vehicle list (1B) ===
See sort vehicle list for [[en/Action0Trains#sort-vehicle-list-1a|trains]] for details.

=== Custom cargo ageing period (1C) ===
See custom cargo ageing period for [[en/Action0Trains#custom-cargo-ageing-period-2b|trains]] for details.
