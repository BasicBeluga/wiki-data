== Wprowadzenie ==

Action 3 przypisuje zestawy graficzne (do których odwołuje się (łańcuchy) [[pl/Development/NewGRF/NFO Specs/Action2/Main Page|action 2(e]] ) do ID''`ów'' funkcji.

{{en/Ottdp|1.10}} Roadtypes are available only in OpenTTD &gt; 1.10

== Format ==

The format of the data is feature-dependent. For roadtypes it looks like

<pre> &lt;Sprite-number&gt; * &lt;Length&gt; 03 12 &lt;n-id&gt; &lt;ids...&gt; &lt;num-cid&gt; &lt;cargo-type&gt; &lt;set-ID&gt;... &lt;default set-ID&gt;</pre>

== Description ==

=== Sprite-number ===

This is just the number you are at.

=== Length ===

Count the number of bytes in this action.

=== n-id ===

How many items of the current feature this action 3 defines new graphics for. If this is more than one, all items listed will get the same graphics. If this value has bit 7 set (i.e. 80 added), it is a wagon override. See [[en/Action3LiveryOverride|Action 3 - Livery Override]] for more info on this feature.

You can make a definition with n-id equal to zero (and thus no ids that follow). &nbsp;This creates a generic feature-specific definition not associated with any particular item. &nbsp;At the moment, this is used for generic callbacks, but might be extended to other functions eventually.

=== ids ===

Feature IDs to use this action 3 for. All IDs are counted from the first of their class, i.e. the first road vehicle has 00, as does the first plane, the first ship, and the first train vehicle.

=== num-cid ===

Number of "cargo" type definitions that follow.

=== cargo-type ===

Roadtypes re-uses in its Action3 the 'cargo'-type definition in order to assign the type of graphics defined by the associated set-ID:

==== Tunnel portal overlay (0A) ====

If this 'cargo' type is defined, tunnels for this railtype will be drawn differently.

First, a grass underlay base sprite is drawn, then the sprite returned from type 03. Next, train sprites if applicable and then a grass overlay and finally the sprite from this type (0A). The grass sprites are defined in the base set and do not contain any parts of the tracks or portal, so these have to be fully provided by the railtype sprites.

Illustration: [[File:RailtypeTunnelExample.png]]

Variable 10 can be used to distinguish between several requested tunnel variations:
{| |-
! Lowest byte of [[GlobalVariables#Extra_callback_info_.2810_.2F_-.29_and_.2818_.2F_-.29|variable 10]] !! Meaning
|-
| 00 || This is a plain portal without any extra features (like tracks above).
|-
| all other values || reserved for future extensions (e.g. basetunnels).
|}
The other bytes of variable 10 are reserved, and must be masked.
-->

=== default set-ID ===

The default set-ID would be used for roadtype callbacks. However, since there are currently no callbacks for roadtypes it should always result in a [[en/Action2/Only Callback Failure|callback-failure]].
