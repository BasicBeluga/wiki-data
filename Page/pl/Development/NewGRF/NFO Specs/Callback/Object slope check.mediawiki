</noinclude>== Object slope check (157) ==

To wywołanie zwrotne jest wywoływane dla każdego kafelka, w którym zostanie zbudowany nowy obiekt.

{{en/GrfTill|7}} For GRF version 7 and below the return values are the same as for [[en/Callbacks#industry-location-permissibility-28|callback 28]], but with bit 10 inverted for backwards compatibility. This means that success is 0 instead of 0x400 while custom GRF texts start at 0x400 instead of 0. Return value 1 stands for "Land sloped in wrong direction" instead of "Site unsuitable".
Note that earlier version of OpenTTD before r22658 and TTDPatch only support 0 for success and 1 for error.

{{en/GrfFrom|8}} For GRF version 8 and above the return values are the same as for [[en/Callbacks#industry-location-permissibility-28|callback 28]]. Return value 401 stands for "Land sloped in wrong direction" instead of "Site unsuitable".

Since the object isn't built yet, only some variables are available. In OpenTTD these are: 41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 48, 60 - 62 and 64.
Additionally you get the following information:
* Variable 10:
{| |-
!Bits !! Meaning
|-
| 0..3 || Relative X position of the tile within the object
|-
| 4..7 || Relative Y position of the tile within the object
|-
| 8..31 || Reserved; must be masked
|}
* Variable 18:
{| |-
!Bits !! Meaning
|-
| 0..4 || Slope of the tile
|-
| 5..31 || Reserved; must be masked
|}
