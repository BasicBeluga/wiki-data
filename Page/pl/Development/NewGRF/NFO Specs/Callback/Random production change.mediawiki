</noinclude>== Random production change (29) ==

Wywoływany, gdy TTD wybiera branżę dla losowej zmiany produkcji. Zmienna 18 zawiera 32 losowe bity, aby pomóc w losowaniu decyzji. Oddzwonienie musi zwrócić jeden z następujących wyników:

Since TTDPatch 2.5 beta 1, you can set bit 7 of this value to suppress the news message announcing the production change.
Be careful with this, especially for closedown messages; most players wouldn't like those being suppressed.

For return values 05..0C, the double/halve news messages are displayed. You should probably replace the defaults with some text that
doesn't explicitly say "double" or "halve", or use the message override feature (see below). If a divide operation brings the
production below the quarter of the default, the industry is closed down instead. Multiply operations that would bring the production
above 8 times of the original will only increase it to that value.

Since TTDPatch r1306, you can override the default news messages that appear after production changes. To do this, you must set bit 8 of the
returned result, and put the textID into the low word of GRF register 100h (the high word of the register is ignored).
The textID can be of a default TTD text or a DCxx text; it '''cannot''' be a D0xx text. If the given action generates a message,
it will be the one you specified. It may, however, not generate messages at all; for example, operation 04 may decide not to change
the production, and then your message won't be shown. There is one exception: operation 00 would never generate a message,
but it still will when bit 8 is set. This is useful in conjunction with [[en/Callbacks#monthly-random-production-change-35 |callback 35]], to tell the player about things that don't
change the production multiplier, but are still important enough to require a news message.

Using return values 0Dh, 0Eh and 0Fh you can adjust production level more smoothly. The production level is a value between 04h and 80h
(initial value 10h). Returning 0Dh when the production is at 4 will close the industry. But returning 0Fh will never close the industry,
instead the value is clamped to the allowed range.
Note that OpenTTD before r15103 did not properly updated production rates provided by properties 12 and 13.
