Definiowanie zaleceń dotyczących etykiet klas obiektów


== Recommendations - Predefined ==

# Predefined labels are best used for single objects that are not part of a comprehensive set
# It is possible to have a label for each object. This would make for a very ungainly menu.
# A labeling system allows a coder/author to make their works much more user friendly.
# To keep the numbers more manageable, the classes are as generic as possible.
# While being generic, assigning objects to a label should be intuitive.
# Assuming that there will be special circumstances where a coder/author needs to deviate from the norm, '''the Recommendation is not mandatory'''.

== Recommendations - Author defined ==

# Author defined labels are best used for comprehensive object sets that consist of several obviously related objects.
# Each label must consist of four (4) alphanumeric characters.
# To prevent menu confusion, new labels should be unique and should not duplicate predefined labels (see chart above) nor previously selected author defined labels (see chart below).
# The author should add their label(s) to the following chart in alphanumeric order.
# If an author is uncomfortable with adding a label to the chart, they can PM their request to [http://www.tt-forums.net/ucp.php?i=pm&amp;mode;=compose&amp;action; wallyweb].
# The chart will be regularly reviewed for duplications.
# The chart will be regularly edited for alphanumeric sequence.
