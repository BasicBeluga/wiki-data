== Etykiety dla rodzajów kolei, rodzajów dróg i typów tramwajów ==
Wszystkie typy ścieżek są identyfikowane za pomocą 4-bajtowych etykiet.
Etykiety są unikalne w swoim typie, ale często szyny i tramwaje używają tej samej etykiety dla podobnych typów.

Pojazdy mogą sprawdzić rodzaj toru na kafelku, ale mają dostęp tylko do własnego typu: na przejeździe kolejowym ze wszystkimi trzema torami (szynowymi, drogowymi, tramwajowymi) pociągi mogą sprawdzać tylko typy szyn, autobusy / ciężarówki mogą tylko sprawdzać typy dróg, a tramwaje mogą sprawdzać tylko typy tramwajów.

=== Rail vs. tram ===
Rail and tram are very different wrt. game-play, but both are kind of rails.
To unify labels, rail and tram should use the same labels, if the tracks are similar.
* RAIL for unelectrified rail and tram.
* ELRL for electrified rail and tram.
* FNCY for fancy-powered rail and tram.

== Default labels ==

=== Rail type ===
These labels are used for the trains and tracks in the base game, as well as for train sets that are not rail-type-aware. Consequently, track NewGRFs should always override their properties, or at least make their tracks compatible to them.

!'''Rail Type'''

|RAIL
|Normal rail
|-
|ELRL

|MONO

=== Road types ===
By default there is only a single road type defined:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!'''Label'''
!'''Road Type'''
|-
|ROAD
|Normal road
|}
However, if a NewGRF requires electrified "ELRD", an Action0 is sufficient to add this type and make it use the default road-ground and catenary sprites.

=== Tram types ===
By default there is only a single tram type defined:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!'''Label'''
!'''Tram Type'''
|-
|ELRL
|Electrified rail
|}
However, if a NewGRF requires unelectrified "RAIL", an Action0 is sufficient to add this type and make it use the default tram-ground sprites.

Note: Please use the same label for tram types which already exist as rail types.

== Standardized Rail Type Scheme ==
Several members of the TT Forums have collaborated to define a rail type label scheme that allows for compatibility between train and track sets by different authors. At the same time it allows fancy stuff like axle weight limits, speed limits, different track and electrification types, etc. It is strongly encouraged to follow this scheme in train and track NewGRFs.

See [[en/Standardized Railtype Scheme]].

== Non-standard railtype labels ==

The following labels were defined before the adoption of the Standardized Rail Type Scheme. They should no longer be used nor supported, and recent versions of the respective NewGRFs generally have dropped them.
