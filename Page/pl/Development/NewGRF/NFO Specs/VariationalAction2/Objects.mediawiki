== Description ==
=== Tile information (41) ===

The return value has the format of ss0t where t is the terrain type which the tile is on, same values as [[en/VarAction2Canals|canal var81]].

As of TTDPatch r2088, ss contains the slope data of the tile, same format as for [[en/VarAction2IndustryTiles#land-info-of-nearby-tiles-60|industrytile var60]]. The meaning of the individual bits is:

{|
!Bit!!Meaning
|-
|0||West corner is above the lowest
|-
|1||South corner is above the lowest
|-
|2||East corner is above the lowest
|-
|3||North corner is above the lowest
|-
|4||The tile is a steep slope (*)
|}

(*) - Steep slopes have this bit plus 3 points raised, giving them values of 0x17, 0x1B, 0x1D and 0x1E.

=== Animation Counter (43) ===

This byte gets the actual value of the animation counter (note that action0, property 10, bit 6 must be set for this to work).

=== Object founder information (44) ===

This byte contains the ID of the company that funded the object, or 10h if the object was placed in the scenario editor.

=== Get [[en/TownZones|town zone]] and Manhattan distance of closest town (45) ===

Like [[en/VarAction2Industries#get-town-zone-and-manhattan-distance-of-closest-town-65|industry var65]] but instead of an offset the current tile is used.

=== Get square of Euclidian distance of closest town (46) ===

Like [[en/VarAction2Industries#get-square-of-euclidean-distance-of-closest-town-66|industry var66]] but instead of an offset the current tile is used.

=== Object colour (47) ===

This byte returns the colour of the object.

(since TTDPatch r2351 and OpenTTD r21259)

=== Get object views (48) ===

Returned value stands for a particular view of an object. Number and rank of set-IDs must match the value given in the object's action0 prop17, i.e. for an object with 4 views, prop48 may return values 0 .. 4. Since OpenTTD r21455.

=== Get object type at offset (60) ===

The parameter of this variable is an offset from the current tile. The low nibble contains the signed X offset (that is 0h=0, 1h=+1 ... 7h=+7, 8h=-8, 9h=-7 ... Fh=-1), the high nibble contains the Y offset. Therefore the parameter 00h accesses the current tile itself.

The variable value has the format
 rrrvtttt

{| |-
! field !! bits !! Meaning
|-
| tttt || 0 - 15
|
* 00xxh if the tile is an object tile and was defined in the current GRF with ID xx.
* FFFEh if the tile is an object tile that was defined in another GRF file or it's a default object.
* FFFFh if the tile isn't an object tile.
|-
| v || 16 - 19 || {{en/Ottdp|1.4|no|ottdrev=r26315}} View of the object, if it is defined in the current GRF.
|-
| rrrr || 20 - 31 || reserved, always mask
|}

=== Get random bits at offset (61) ===

Returns the same values as [[en/VarAction2Industries#get-random-tile-bits-at-offset-61|industry var61]]. The offset it from the current tile and is signed.

To get the random bits from a tile using a offset relative to the north tile of the object, see the example below.

=== Land info of nearby tiles (62) ===

Returns the same values as [[en/VarAction2IndustryTiles#land-info-of-nearby-tiles-60|industry tile var60]]. The offset it from the current tile and is signed.

To get the land info from a tile using a offset relative to the north tile of the object, see the example below.

=== Animation counter of nearby tile (63) ===

Returns the var43 of another tile given by the signed offset.

To get the animation counter from a tile using a offset relative to the north tile of the object, see the example below.

=== Count of object, distance of closest instance (64) ===

Returns the same values as [[en/VarAction2Industries#count-of-industry-distance-of-closest-instance-67-68|industry var67]]. The distance is from the current tile.

== Examples ==

=== Getting the north tile random bits ===

The following code uses variable 40, 61 and 7B to read the random bits of the north tile of the object.

<pre>    0 * 0    02 0F xx 81
                       40      30 FF   // Get relative position of object tile as yx
               \2^     1A      20 77   // Negate the numbers in bits 0..3 and 4..7 ...
               \2+     1A      20 11   // ... (here we can optionally insert another (positive) offset, to get some other tile relative to the north tile)
               \2^     1A      20 88   // ... (we need to split the xor in two parts, so bits 0..3 do not influence bits 4..7)
               \2rst   7B 61   00 FF   // Get the random bits at the northern tile
                        ...</pre>
