Начиная с 2004 года были попытки модернизировать графику игры с помощью увеличения глубины цвета и детализации изображений. Этот проект получил название '''Разработка 32-х битной графики''', соответсвенно глубине цвета новых спрайтов.

<font size="3">'''Development process in a nutshell'''</font>

A 32bpp graphics artist develops their graphics mostly in 3D modeling software, which at the end of the creative process is set to render an the 3D model into a 2D sprite, which is then shown in game. Getting these [https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable Network Graphics png] sprites to show in game has required major revisions into the game's graphics engine.

Some topics concerning the feature-completeness of 32bpp graphics remain disputed to this day - to name one undecided matter, whether the game should support only the same maximum zoom level of the original game, or a few levels more.

For more information on creating 32bpp graphics, see [[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/32bit Graphics Development Documentation]].

<div style="margin:1em;padding:1em;border:1px solid #c7c8fe;background:#f1f2fe;">
<font size="3">'''Normal zoom and full zoom'''</font>

Currently, the game officially supports the same amount of zoom levels for 8bb and 32bpp sprites. Custom builds by GeekToo support two extra levels of zoom. For the official builds, we have the '''32bpp normal zoom graphics'''. For additional zoom levels, we have the '''[[en/Community/NewGRF/Playing with 32 bpp graphics|32bpp full zoom graphics]]'''.

There has traditionally been a gap between these two builds when it comes to graphics development, but these days it is recommended for an artist to render sprites for both builds, as the extra work required is perceived by some to be worth the possibility of 32bpp extra zoom becoming included in the official builds.

Full zoom level allows for much greater detail in the finished product, but this can only be considered eye candy, as playability at such close proximity to the ground becomes questionable.

<font size="3">'''Project organization'''</font>

Artists are free to work on whatever item they desire, but it is recommended that they first [[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/32bpp graphics development tracker|check the normal]] and [[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/32bpp graphics development tracker (extra zoom)|full zoom progress trackers]] here at the wiki for items that haven't been rendered in 32bpp.

Every time an artist works on any 32bpp graphics item, it is requested that the files in question are uploaded to the [[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/32bit Graphics Development File Repository]] under the GPLv2 license. This is mostly to avoid loss of material in case development of the file ceases for technical, personal or other reasons.

New graphics, engine features, bug reports, suggestions and other discussion take place at [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=36 the 32bpp graphics development section at tt-forums]. There are general threads for [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=14549 32bpp normal zoom] and [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=36474 32bpp full zoom] graphics. Administrative matters are discussed in the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=46667 "Organizing 32bpp sprites" thread]. There is an ongoing effort in the [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=46682 "32Bpp Graphics Pack" thread] to collect completed sprites off the repository into a full, easily installed set for the end user.

Sprites can also be downloaded individually via links at the progress trackers.

When an item is completed, it is primarily the artist's responsibility to keep progress trackers up to date and notify distributors of the existence of their new content. There are volunteers working these administrative tasks but it is in the best interest of the project for the artist to do this themselves if they can.

<font size="3">'''Not a 3D modeler? You can still contribute'''</font>

There are a few of ways to contribute to the project besides making 3D models and rendering them. Namely, administrative tasks here at the wiki (progress trackers, etc.), testing graphics and giving feedback, improving the 32bpp graphics engine by means of programming and "coding graphics".

Coding graphics means inputting correct pixel offsets for the sprites so that they line up properly in the game world. This is not difficult and we use a tool called [[en/Archive/Old 32bpp/PNGCodec]] for the coding. It is a slightly time consuming and repetitive business, which is why we need contributions there every now and then.
