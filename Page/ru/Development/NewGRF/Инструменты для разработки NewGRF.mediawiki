There are a few tools which are required in order to produce NewGRFs:

* [http://www.openttd.org/download-grfcodec grfcodec] - the most fundamental one as it encodes and decodes NewGRF from the NFO (newgrf description language) to the grf file used by the game
* [http://www.openttd.org/download-nforenum nforenum] - a tool which checks nfo files for errors and allows to use some very slightly abstracted syntax in some places

* [http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=68&t=10167 GRFMaker] - a tool which abstracts from the NFO and allows to generate nfo files without diving into near-hex editing. It has not yet implemented all features which NFO offers.
