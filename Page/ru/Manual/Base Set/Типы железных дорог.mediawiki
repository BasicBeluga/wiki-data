[[ru/Manual/Base Set/Железные дороги|Железные дороги]] are the only railway available at the start of the game (unless the game is started at a very early date). Only steam and diesel trains run on this railway (unless the advanced setting [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles#disable-electric-rails|"Disable electric rails"]] is on).

==Electrified railway==

==Monorail==
