[[File:en/Manual/Dedicated server.png|right|frame|Dedicated server window]]A '''dedicated server''' is a OpenTTD network game [[en/Manual/Server]] that does not have a local client taking part in the game. A dedicated server can run in the background on a computer.

==Starting a dedicated server==
Run the OpenTTD executable using the {{en/C|-D|}} (capital D!) [[en/Manual/Command line]] option. 

===In Windows===
Method 1:
*Create a shortcut to {{en/C|openttd.exe|}}
*Right-click on the shortcut and click Properties
*Add {{en/C|-D|}} onto the end of the Target line
*Click Apply
*Run the shortcut


Method 2:
*On the start menu click Run
*Enter: {{en/C|"c:\(path to openttd)\openttd.exe" -D|}}
*Click OK

===In Linux===
*Run {{en/C|openttd -D|}} in a terminal. If you are connecting to the server via SSH and would like the game to run when you logout you should use [http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/ GNU Screen] or [http://dtach.sourceforge.net/ dtach].

You can also start openttd with -f option. It means that the process will run in the background, but no console will be avaible. All output will be sent to the file openttd.log. You can display the log with tail : tail -f openttd.log to follow events.

===In OS/2===
*Run the {{en/C|dedicated.cmd|}} file. If you run {{en/C|openttd -D|}}, you will not see a console window and will be unable to provide commands to the program.

===In Mac OS X===
*Open Terminal.
*cd into the directory with OpenTTD
*type cd OpenTTD.app/Contents/MacOS/
*type ./openttd -D
*OpenTTD should start up in Dedicated Server.

==Configuring the server==
There are 3 ways to change the game options:
*Launch a single player game, change the settings, and close the game.
*Use the [[en/Manual/Console#server-commands|console commands]] to control the server while it is running.
*Edit the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]] file manually. See [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Diff custom]] for some help.

Change the network settings in the Network section of [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg]]:
*Set [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Lan internet]] to 0.
*Change [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Server name]] so you can identify the server, 
*Set [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Server advertise]] to true, so it will be visible on the [[en/Server list]]
*If you have multiple network interfaces make sure you set [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Server bind ip]].
*If you are behind a router, make sure that you forward the port specified by [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Server port]] (both TCP and UDP)

==Controlling the server with rcon==
Configure the dedicated server to accept [[en/Manual/Console#server-commands|rcon]] commands:
*In the dedicated server window, type {{en/C|rcon_pw <password>|}}. 
:Example: {{en/C|rcon_pw x8na7f|}}


Connect to the server as a client:
*Launch OpenTTD normally.
*Find your server on the multiplayer list and connect to it.
*Open the console (~ key).
*Type {{en/C|rcon <password> "<command>"|}}. 
:Example: {{en/C|rcon x8na7f "kick 5"|}}

==Loading a game==
In the dedicated server window (or with rcon):
*Type {{en/C|ls|}} to list the files of the current directory, a number will be beside each one, which represents {{en/C|<number>|}} below.
*Type {{en/C|cd <number>|}} to go to that directory.
*Type {{en/C|load <number>|}} to load that file.

*You can also load savegames and scenarios with the {{en/C|-g "<filename>"|}}, command line option. 
:Example: {{en/C|openttd.exe -D -g "scenario/echo.scn"|}}.
