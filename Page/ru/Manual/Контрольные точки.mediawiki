Машинисты поездов в OpenTTD не всегда так же умны, как настоящие, особенно в очень сложных сетях. Это ведёт к тому, что они теряются время от времени.  

You can help combat this by using '''waypoints'''.  These are 1x1-sized "destinations" that can be placed on a track and then included on a train's [[en/Manual/Orders]] to indicate that a train should go here on the way to a [[en/Manual/Stations]].

==When to use waypoints==

* Routing trains through a certain track.
* Make certain trains use a specific platform on a station.
* Detouring trains to relieve heavy traffic routes.

Waypoints force the trains to go through a certain track, giving the player more control over their vehicles.

==How to build and schedule waypoints==

# Build your route.
# Choose the waypoints button from the [[en/Manual/Railway construction#railway-construction-toolbar|rail construction toolbar]].
# Click on a straight piece of track where you want to build the waypoint. Alternatively multiple waypoints can be joined into one using [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Distant-join stations|distant-join]].

You can add a waypoint to a train's [[en/Manual/Orders]] in the same way as any other destination (for example a [[en/Manual/Stations]]). Waypoints appear in orders prefixed with ''Go via Waypoint''.

== Newgrf waypoints ==
Waypoints allow for newgrf changing. Available NewGRFs with custom waypoint graphics are for example [http://grfcrawler.tt-forums.net/details.php?do=details&id=13 Newstations] from Michael Blunck and the [http://grfcrawler.tt-forums.net/details.php?do=details&id=104 UK Waypoints] from Born_Acorn.

Like building normal waypoints, click on the waypoint icon, and you will be presented with a GUI. Choose the style of waypoint you want, then click down on track as you would do normally.
