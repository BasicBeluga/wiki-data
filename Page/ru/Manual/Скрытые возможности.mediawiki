There are many features within OpenTTD with no GUI buttons or easily accessible to operate. To most inexperienced users, these are '''Hidden Features'''.

Here is a list of the hidden features, which are helpful, but not necessarily obvious even to experienced players. Feel free to complete this list.

The ctrl button can be very useful.  Holding it down while clicking can make tedious tasks much faster.
