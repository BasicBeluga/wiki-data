[[Translation:en/Archive/Community/FAQ OpenTTD versions]]



OpenTTD je projekat koji se neprestano razvija novim mogućnostima, mogućnostima i poboljšanjima, koja se redovno objavljuju. Iako je često uvođenje novina nešto na šta su veterani OpenTTD-a navikli, takva praksa može da predstavlja problem novajlijama OpenTTD-a, prilikom izbora verzije igre ili prilikom informisanja koja verzija igre je tabilna, odnosno koje opcije ima određena verzija igre.

=== "Nightly?"  "RC?"  "Trunk?"  Šta?===
Razumevanje termina koje programeri koriste za razlikovanje različitih verzija igre je prvi korak ka razlikovanju šta koja verzija igre nosi i kakva je po pitanju stabilnosti.

====Build====
"Build" je opšti pojam koji se koristi za određenu verziju igre. Build može predstavljati zvaničnu, a samim tim i stabilnu verziju OpenTTD-a ili poslednju verziju igre, gde je moguće da ima bagova. Ako ste tehnički potkovani, možete i sami kompajlirati sopstvenu verziju odnosno build, u koji ćete uneti opcije i mogućnosti koje se Vama dopadaju.

Termin "build" ćemo koristiti u nastavku dokumenta i odnosiće se na određenu verziju igre.

====Izdanje====
Zvanično Izdanje je upravo to -- stabilna, zaokružena verzija igre. Ispravke manjih grešaka su moguće kod Izdanja, ne i ispravke većih grešaka ili nova unapređenja, koja obično dolaze sa novim Izdanjem.  

Poput izdanja bilo kog softvera i izdanja OpenTTD su obeležena odgovarajućim brojem.  Na primer, zadnje izdanje OpenTTD-a je {{en/Version}}. Glavna Izdanja su označena prvom ili drugom cifrom, dok su Manja Izdanja označena trećom cifrom.

====Kandidati za Izdanje (RC or testing)====
U neku ruku, Kandidati za Izdanje, su Izdanja koja su pred samim finišom. Manja poboljšanja su moguća u ovom stepenu razvoja Izdanja, ali uglavnom, lista poboljšanja ostaje nepromenjena. 

Ono što pravi razliku između Izdanja i Kandidata za Izdanje je  kloičina preostalog testiranja i otklanjanja grešaka. Kandidati za izdanje su poprilično stabilni, ali postoji mogućnost pojavljivanja grešaka.

Kandidati za Izdanje se obeležavaju na sledeći način: 
''[Release version] RC[Candidate number]''

Na primer, poslednji Kandidat za Izdanje bio je ''1.2.0 RC3''. Kada se potvrdi da je stabilan Kandidat će postati zvanično Izdanje  1.2.0.

Kandidati su obično uglavnom stabilni, tako da se preporučuje njegova instalacija, ako je dostupan, nego instaliranje starijeg zvaničnog izdanja, koje nema neke novine, koje Kandidat poseduje. Kao što smo rekli Kandidat za Izdanje je u osnovi Izdanje, kome treba još poliranja.

====Nightly Build (Nightly)====
"Nightly builds" are generally works-in-progress.  A nightly will contain OpenTTD's cutting-edge features (usually features planned for the next Release), but can expected to be unstable and buggy.  Nightlies have the potential to corrupt your saved games, so you should backup all your important data files before installing a nightly build.

As the name suggests, nightly builds are compiled frequently, and thus new features become available in OpenTTD on a regular basis.  If you find yourself hearing about a feature of OpenTTD, but don't see it in your version, it was most likely released in a nightly build.  Weigh the risks (which are substantially lowered by backing up your data -- get the hint?  {{en/Emoticon|:)}}), and install a nightly if you want a feature not yet available in a Release or an RC. The latest nightly can always be downloaded at http://www.openttd.org/en/download-trunk. Note that a nightly build does not require installation - simply unzip the folder and open OpenTTD.exe to play.


Nightly builds have a different numbering schema than Releases do.  A nightly version will be numbered like:
''r8642''

====Trunk====
[[File:en/Archive/Community/Version Illustration.gif|frame|right|How the Trunk, Branches, Releases, Nightlies, and Release Candidates relate]]
The term "trunk" (as in the trunk of a tree) refers to the main development environment for the developers of OpenTTD (contrast this with the "branch" terminology described below).  The trunk contains code either developed  or approved by the core developers of the game.  The code contained in the trunk is anticipated to make its way into an official Release.  By extension, code found in the trunk can be thought of as the "official" code of OpenTTD.

Nightly builds, as described above, will always contain the latest code "in the trunk."  Thus, if you see a feature described as "in the trunk", you can be sure it will be available in the next nightly build, if it is not already.

====Branch or SVN Branch====
Usually an "SVN Branch" is created for a specific feature, feature set, or functionality that is being developed as a candidate for inclusion in the trunk (and eventually in a Release), but is still very much "on probation".  SVN branches have not been tested with the other, latest features of OpenTTD, and therefore may corrupt or undo the work other developers have done.  The work being done on a branch is independent of work being done in the trunk. Think again in terms of a tree -- a branch originates from the trunk, but grows out from it.

If an SVN branch can be verified by other developers as stable both within itself and in conjunction with features being developed elsewhere, the branch may be later merged back into the effort as part of a nightly.  Until this is confirmed, however, there are no guarantees that features from one branch will work with those from another.  It is recommended that if you want to utilize features being developed in an SVN branch, you start with the build at which point the SVN branched off, and then install the code from the branch.

So, for example, if the latest nightly version was released on Friday, but the SVN branch code has been a separate development effort since Monday, you should work from the nightly that was released on Monday, and then install the SVN branch atop it.

As you can see, this is a feature tradeoff -- you get the feature(s) in the branch that you want, but you probably do '''not''' get the latest features released in the main branch/trunk.

Just like nightlies, SVN branches should be expected to be buggy and perhaps unstable.  In addition, SVN branches typically have been subjected to less testing than the main branch (i.e. fewer sets of eyes have looked at the code), which makes them potentially even less stable.

====Patch====
A "patch", generally speaking, is a bit of code or functionality developed by someone outside of the core developers of the game.  This does not necessarily imply that a patch is in some way inferior to the trunk code, it just means that it contains functionality and/or code that has not (yet) been approved for inclusion in a future release of the game.

Whereas work on the trunk (and to a lesser extent, an SVN branch) is done by a discrete set of developers, patches can be created by anyone.  This opens up great possibilities for creativity and new functionality, but also introduces a higher risk factor because, well, patches can be created by anyone.

Patches cannot be directly installed like nightlies can -- they must be compiled on a user's machine.

====MiniIN====
{{en/Feature period|Old|0.5}}
[[File:en/Archive/Community/MiniIN Illustration.gif|frame|right|The MiniIN]]
''Main Article: [[en/Archive/Community/Mini Integrated Nightly]]''<br>

The MiniIN is a development environment separate from the trunk that contains the trunk code ''plus'' many user patches.  After the release of 0.5.0, the MiniIN will no longer be updated with the trunk code. At that stage the MiniIN will be 0.5.0 plus all the user patches.

===Which version of OpenTTD should I install?===
Start with the latest Release (or Release Candidate, if there is one).  Go to the [http://www.openttd.org/download-stable OpenTTD Downloads page].  The latest stable version should always be listed there.

Many people are satisfied with the major Releases.  If, however, you hear about a feature you'd like to have, then [http://nightly.openttd.org/ download the latest nightly] on top of your stable version (remember, back up your saved games!)

Only if you feel like you've really got this version thing down (in which case, why are you reading this?) should you try to install an SVN branch build.

===I heard someone talking about [x feature].  Why don't I have that in my game?===
You could have a different build installed.  Many of the newest (and sometimes coolest) features are only part of a nightly (i.e. in the Trunk) at this point, though they hopefully will be part of a future Official Release.

If you know you have the right version installed it may be able to be turned on in the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings|Advanced Settings window]].

===How do I keep track of what features are where?===
* An overview of major features included or planned in various Releases can be found under [[en/Archive/Lists/Roadmap]]s
* Details of recent changes to the trunk are [http://vcs.openttd.org/svn/log/trunk here]
