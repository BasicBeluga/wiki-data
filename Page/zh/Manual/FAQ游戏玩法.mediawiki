=====sss 整理的常见问题=====
Q: 如何获得单轨列车和磁悬浮列车？我试过点击转换铁路，然后点击铁路，但是什么都没有发生！！！！
大佬救！！！！<BR>
A: 我也遇到过类似的问题，你需要做的就是长按铁路建设图标按钮，然后就可以选择其他类型的铁路了。另外：转换铁路类型是用来转换铁路(就先假设是普通铁路)为，就先假设为磁悬浮铁路，所以你需要先选择磁悬浮铁路，然后再点击转换铁路，再然后拖拽到你的旧型铁路上<BR>
Q: 新的列车不显示！！！！<BR>
A: 使用其他类型的铁路，如电气化铁路、磁悬浮铁路或单轨铁路<BR>
Q: 车库没有可选的电气化类型列车！！！！<BR>
A: 确保选择的车库是电气化铁路类型的车库。

Q: RV？露营房车？<BR>
A: 不是，RV 是指 Road Vehicles.<BR>
Q: 我安装了EGRVT'S，然后我的马车速度达到了 1 mph！！！！<BR>
A: 前往高级设置>车辆，然后设置汽车加速模型为原版。<BR>
飞机<BR>
Q: 什么鬼？？？？我的 140 MPH 行驶的慢速列车比我的 300 MPH 的飞机还要快？？？？<BR>
A: 前往高级设置>车辆，飞机速度因子设置为 1/1

==重要操作==
:*[[zh/Manual/教程/调度任务|设置调度任务]]

==如何获取(好的)利润==
:* 查看'货物运费价格'(在图表图标[[File:en/Manual/Manual html 36354981.png]]) 看什么东西能够给你带来丰厚的利润
:* 搜索大型城市(在城镇列表 [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m58c015ad.png]])，和有最高产出的工业设施(在工业列表 [[File:en/Manual/Manual html m4d6ba21e.png]])
:* 建造长途运输路线，路线尽量保持同一高度，不要有太多弯道(追求速度最大化)
:* 在载具调度计划中使用 '[[en/Manual/Orders#full-load|Full load]]' 选项
:* 对于逾期需要缴纳罚款的货物(旅客、邮件、易腐货物)，最佳运输距离是约为 70 天。130 天适用于逾期不需要缴纳罚款的货物(原油、煤炭、木材等)，不同货物之间确切的值不同，但是 70-130 天之间是合理的基准数值。
::* In 70 days, a vehicle will move a distance equal to its average speed x 2.5 tiles, and in 130 days, its average speed x 4.5. So if a vehicle has a speed of 60 kph, its optimum delivery distance is about 150 tiles for perishables, and 270 tiles for non-perishables.
::* Vehicle speeds in mph would give multipliers of x4 and x7; so a 45 mph vehicle should travel 180 or 315 tiles.
::* It's easy not to ship cargos far enough, and sending them too far is a much rarer mistake.

==There is no cargo at my stations!==
By default, cargo from industries is not delivered to stations until a demand exists.
In other words, until you send a vehicle to the station for getting the cargo, none will appear.
The reason for this behaviour is that it prevents you from getting bad ratings due to perishing of cargoes you don't want to transport at all.

In the advanced settings, you can switch between this behaviour and the case where all cargoes are always delivered to stations.

==Why does cargo at my stations disappear?==
That happens when you are not providing a sufficiently good service to the stations. The worse your station rating, the less cargo will be allocated to the station in the first place, and where the rating is below 50%, even the cargo that is there will gradually disappear.

To fix this problem, increase the rating. See also the answer to the next question.

==How to maximize 'Local rating of transport service'==
:Read about [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#station-rating|station rating]] and [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#local-authority-rating|town rating]].

==How to disable opening and closing of industries==
:[http://grfcrawler.tt-forums.net/details.php?do=details&id=244 Manual Industries]

A newer version for OpenTTD, 1.1.x (currently, nightlies only) is available as ''Manual Industries'' in bananas, the online content system.

==Is it possible to use the operating system cursor instead of the sluggish OpenTTD cursor?==
It is possible, with a few minor changes to the code, but at the moment there is no option for it. Alternatively, you might code a [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] to do it.

==How do I relocate the main toolbar and statusbar, since it's 'centred' on a dual-display?==
In [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Interface]] there are options to set the position of the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Interface#position-of-the-main-toolbar|main toolbar]] and the [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Interface#position-of-statusbar|statusbar]] to left, centre or right.

==How to get expired vehicles back?==
After 2050 vehicles expire, which means they are no longer available for you. That is really bad if you want to open a new service!

See the page [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Never expire vehicles]] on how to avoid that.

==How long is a game day in real time?==
One game day takes 2220ms (2.22 seconds) real time. A game year thus takes 810.3 seconds, or 13.505 minutes.

==Why are my vehicles not serviced?==
Make sure that:
* breakdowns are on,
* servicing when breakdowns are off is off,
* the depot is within 20 squares of the path your vehicle is following.

Note that the '20 squares' to the depot must have suitable roads or tracks for the vehicle to use. Road crossings, signals, bridges and other obstacles all count towards the limit.

==How to get computer opponents (AIs) in my game?==
Starting with version 0.7.0, the default computer opponent has been removed.
As a replacement, you can now download opponents from the online content system, or even develop your own AI opponent!
See
* The [[en/Manual/AI settings]] page describes how to download and activate opponents.
* The [[en/Community/AI/Comparison of AIs]] page describes the available opponents.
* The [[en/Development/Script/Main Page]] describes how to program your own opponents, in case you want to make a better one.

==How to disable trains reversing at signals?==
See [[en/Community/Disable Train Reversing]]

==My train is going in the wrong direction!! Why?==
The path finder is quite clever in routing the trains. If they head off in the 'wrong' direction, it normally means there really is no shorter path. Some simple things to check:
* Missing track piece (maglev makes seeing that hard)
* Wrong track type/no electrification; one track tile that you forgot to electrify can cause all your new electric trains to be unable to reach their destination
* Your trains are not allowed to go round 90 degree curves, but the only way contains them
* Difficulty options forbid reversing at stations
* There really is no way (check for detours due to servicing).
* Signals of wrong type and/or direction

==Why are my aircraft disappearing?==
Big planes have a high chance to crash while landing at small or commuter airports. See also [[en/Manual/Aircraft#accidents]].

==Why are my road vehicles disappearing?==
If you have very fast trains and level crossings, vehicles may not be able to get out of the way before the train arrives. The vehicle will be crushed and destroyed, and the train will just continue on its way. There is also a 'small UFO' disaster which will destroy road vehicles occasionally.
