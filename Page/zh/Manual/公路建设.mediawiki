公路系统相当适合用作启动阶段的交通网络，因为它快捷、成本低、容易建造。一个公路网络的收益可能不如一个设计得当的铁路网络。但是，可以利用道路运输构建[[en/Manual/Feeder service|衔接服务(en)]]，以对铁道网络起到有效的补充作用。

==道路建造工具条==

在游戏界面的工具栏点击“建造道路”[[File:en/Manual/Road build button.png]]以显示道路建造工具条。

Besides building on flat land roads, depots and stations can also be [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Build on slopes|built on slopes]].

==Building road vehicles==
To build a [[en/Manual/Road vehicles|road vehicle]], place a [[en/Manual/Depots]] and then click it. You will be presented with the depot window. Select "Build new vehicles" and a new window will pop up with a list of vehicles. Select one and click "Buy Vehicle" at the bottom of this window. The vehicle will appear in the depot window and the vehicle's control window will open. Give it orders or refit it as necessary, then click on the red "Stopped" button to get it rolling!

==Building one-way roads==
[[File:en/Manual/Oneway.png|right|frame|The sign with the arrow is the one-way build button]]
One-way roads are built by using the normal road build tools and clicking on the one-way road button. Roads will then be one-way in the direction they are dragged. One-way roads may also be built over previously built roads, but only if they are player-owned. Only the entrance tile to a stretch of roads needs to be one-way. Blocking tiles are built by dragging one way to build, then dragging over the other way.

[[File:en/Manual/Oneways.png|left|frame|All possible One-Way roads]]
The image shows all the possible roads. The first two show the one-way in the specific directions. The third one is a both-one-way road or to be more specific, it's a blocking tile. No vehicle can cross it (as the grf shows). The last one is the default road without any one-way direction. One-way bridges are not possible (yet?).

[[en/Manual/Tramways|Trams]] ignore whether the road is one-way or blocking. They'll always run over it in both ways.
