[[Translation:en/Manual/Local authority]]

每个城镇都有一个'''地方政府'''负责管理[[zh/Manual/城镇]]及周边地区。

地方政府负责发放建造车站、地形改造和拆除城镇财产的许可证。 如果[[en/Manual/Transport company]]的[[zh/Manual/游戏机制#di-fang-zheng-fu-ping-ji|地方政府评价]]过低，他们可能会拒绝公司在当地建造运输站点。地方政府还是环保主义者，他们会对公司砍伐树木、摧毁城镇财产和遗弃运输站点的行为感到愤怒。但是，并非无法补救，短时间内种植树木可以平息他们的怒火，或者提供良好的运输服务来在长时间内慢慢平息。

==管辖范围==
地方政府管辖城镇及周边区域的地块。使用[[File:en/Manual/Manual html 51cda05b.png|查询地块信息]]工具查看地块是否处于地方政府的管辖。远离城镇的地块不受地方政府的管辖，在那里砍伐树木没有任何负面影响。

==评价==
For any town, the local authority rates each transport company based on its actions and provided transport services.  This rating determines what player actions are allowed within its area of influence and is not the same as station ratings.
:''See [[en/Manual/Game Mechanics/Main Page#local-authority-rating|game mechanics]] for more technical information.''

==Things to do==
These actions are available in the local authority window, provided a transport company has enough money. The local authority window is opened by clicking on the name of a town in the map, then on the ''Local authority'' button in the town window.

'''Note:  All the following actions need money.  If the player doesn't have enough money for an option, it won't be available.'''

===Advertising campaigns===
Advertising temporarily raises nearby station ratings, attracting more customers to a transport company's services and away from the competition. Assuming the ability to afford it, the player can choose from any of three sizes of advertising campaign: small, medium, and large.  The larger the campaign, the more powerful it is and the bigger area it affects.

===Build statue of company owner===
A transport company may build a statue in honour of its owner. This will increase its ratings at stations in the area, and looks impressive to passers by.

===Fund new buildings===
Funds new commercial buildings, expanding a town's business district for about three months (e.g. upgrading the roads to have streetlights). Like [[en/Manual/Industries#prospecting-new-industries|funding a new industry]], a company gets no return on its investment except the for the potential new supply of customers for its service (no rent, shared profits, or the like). Funding new buildings again during this period resets the 3 month countdown.

===Fund local road construction===
Fund the reconstruction of the urban road network. Causes considerable disruption to road traffic for up to six months. Use this to frustrate other players in multiplayer. There is no other benefit in the basic version of the game although there is a [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Remove absurd road-elements during the road construction|setting]] for this. Incidentally, vehicles don't go any faster after the roads are re-built. A news headline will appear when road construction is set to begin.

===Buy exclusive transport rights===
[[File:en/Manual/Exclusive transport rights.png|frame|right|Tenley Transport has acquired exclusive transport rights, as indicated by the crown icon]]
Buys a year's exclusive transport rights in the area of the local authority.  Passengers and cargo will only be allowed to use the transport services of the purchasing company during that time.  Conveniently, other players will not be directly notified of this although they can find out by checking the Local authority screen for themselves.

===Bribe the local authority===
If you really need to improve a town's opinion of your company (maybe to get something built), you can resort to bribes.  These are very expensive and risky but can raise your rating quickly. 

Every time you try for a bribe, there is a possibility you'll be caught by the "regional investigator". If this happens, the company will lose out on some cargo and not be able to make any further contact with that town's local authority for six months. 

The [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Bribe authority|bribe setting]] must be enabled. This option is not available if a company's rating is already "outstanding".
