==城镇建筑==
城镇内的大多数[[en/Archive/Manual/Building|建筑(en)]]会提供[[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Passengers|旅客(en)]]和[[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Mail|邮件(en)]]，他们可被运输到同一城镇或其他城镇的站点。在[[en/Manual/Economy#recession|经济衰退(en)]]期间，旅客和邮件的产出将会减半。

部分情况下，城镇也会接受其它货物，比方说[[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Goods|货物(en)]]和[[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Food|食物(en)]]。若一个站点接受货物，车站范围内的建筑需总计至少接受8/8的该货物。使用[[en/Manual/Land area information|地块信息查询工具(en)]]来知晓每个建筑能接受多少货物。

城镇的人口根据建筑的数量以及各建筑物内的居民数进行计算而得。

==城镇工业==
Certain Industries locate within towns:
* the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Bank]] can be found in towns with populations of over 1200 (Temperate climate), Banks can be found in any town in Sub-Arctic.
* the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Water Tower]] found in desert towns in the Sub-Tropical climate.

==城镇的发展==
随着城镇发展，城镇的人口会有增长，从而提供更多可供运输的旅客/邮件。

城镇通过以下两种方式来发展扩大： 
* 现有的建筑会被城镇拆除，并被更大的建筑代替。在此期间你可能会注意到城镇的人口会暂时下降。
* 城镇在紧邻城镇道路的空地上建设新建筑。

有时新建筑会增加城镇可以接受的货物种类和/或其对应的数量（比方说[[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Goods|货物(en)]]）。

即使未提供任何运输服务，随着时间推移城镇仍将会非常缓慢地发展扩大；然而玩家可以通过多种方式影响城镇的发展。

===城镇发展的通常情况===
Town growth can be accelerated by '''loading or unloading at least one item of cargo at up to five stations within town influence within a 50 day period'''.  It does not matter which cargos are loaded/unloaded. 

Towns will expand physically by extending roads onto empty areas of the map, then constructing new buildings next to the new roads.  Roads can't be built over diagonal train tracks or tracks with signals on, so be careful not to hem your towns in completely when building your transport empire.

Pre-built road networks can speed up town growth, as the town can build houses all the time instead of houses plus roads. If towns are allowed to build roads and the road layout is a grid, the pre-built roads should match this grid, otherwise they block house tiles.

A big city needs plenty of space. Without obstacles, a population of 1 million requires roughly 150-200 tiles diameter depending on road layout and the types of buildings available, transportation systems or other objects may increase this number.

===与气候相关联的城镇发展===
====温带气候、玩具大陆====
在温带气候和玩具大陆气候下，城镇发展不需要特殊的条件。只需按上文所述装载/卸货即可。

====亚寒带气候====
[[File:en/Manual/Arctic town.png|right]]If centre square of the town is above the snow level, at least 1t of food per month must be delivered for the town to grow rapidly.  The town information window will show whether food was delivered recently.

The towns will grow very slowly on their own, so in the case of small towns not large enough to accept food, it is simply a case of waiting for them to grow. As with any other cargo a station needs at least 8/8 of food acceptance in its coverage area before it accepts food.

The amount of food delivered has no effect on the rate of town growth.

If the centre square is not above the snow line, food is not required for growth, although food will be accepted. In cases of varying snow lines, a town will only grow during the summer if food is not provided.

====亚热带气候==== 
[[File:en/Manual/Town tropical.png|right]]If the centre square of the town is in the desert, at least 1t of [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Food]] and 1,000L of [[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Water]] per month must be delivered for the town to grow.  The town information window will show whether food and water was delivered recently.

The towns will grow very slowly on their own, so in the case of small towns not large enough to accept food, it is simply a case of waiting for them to grow. As with any other cargo a station needs at least 8/8 of food acceptance in its coverage area before it accepts food.

[[File:en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Water tower.gif|right]]
Water must be delivered to a Water Tower industry. Water Towers may be generated automatically in towns, or a player may choose to fund one using the "Fund new industry" menu.

The amount of food and water delivered has no effect on the rate of town growth.

If the centre square is not in the desert, food and water are not required for growth, although Water Towers may still exist in the town and food/water will be accepted.

===发展城镇的要点===
In the Temperate climate, a simple bus service can drastically increase the population of a town. It is sensible to connect not-too-distant small towns together with bus services to bulk-up their population before a train station or airport becomes viable. Alternatively, creating a bus route within a larger town can produce an even higher rate of growth. The bigger the buildings, the bigger the passenger rate. If you are transporting passengers, be sure the population is '''more''' than 500.

* A bus with one passenger from the other side of town would have the same effect on growth as a large train full of passengers from the other end of the map.  
* A town with a feeder station where cargo is picked up but not set down will also grow.
* A player can choose "Fund New Buildings" from the Local Authority window. This may result in rapid population growth for a short time, or increase acceptance of cargos such as Goods.
* Cities grow 2x faster than other towns.
* Players can try and ensure towns are not hemmed in by train tracks, airports, water etc.
* Extending roads for a town may slightly increase the chance of new buildings being constructed successfully, and it is better than town without a pre-built road network. If the town has plenty of empty roads to build on, this is unlikely to have an effect until most roads have buildings constructed alongside them. Roads should be evenly constructed around the town rim rather than extending to few particular sides. Also, the progress of the town building construction depends on the travel distance (not vector distance) along the road to the town centre (where the town name displays). Roads which are close but disjointed to the town centre will have no buildings being constructed alongside of it.

Delivering the cargo "[[en/Manual/Base Set/Cargos/Goods]]" '''does not''' have any extra effect on town growth in any climate than any other type of cargo. The reason for this common misunderstanding is that towns which can accept Goods in early game are usually City class (meaning they grow naturally faster than regular towns) and a town receiving Goods tends to be forgotten by the player after some time, so when the player check the town again it appears to have suddenly grown unexpectedly.

==城市==
A city is a special form of town that will grow twice as fast as a regular town. A city is also larger to begin with. There are two settings that affect cities: ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Economy#proportion-of-towns-that-will-become-cities|Proportion of towns that will become cities]]'' and ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Economy#initial-city-size-multiplier|Initial city size multiplier]]''.

==城镇的地方政府==
Each town is managed by a [[en/Manual/Local authority]] that determines which actions a [[en/Manual/Transport company]] may take in or near each town. Clearing trees (including those cleared by landscaping or bulldozing), destroying town's industries, buildings, roads, tunnels and bridges, and leaving abandoned stations in the town (stations that have not transferred cargo in the last 50 days) all lower the company rating in the town. However, planting trees, successful bribes and providing services to the town (stations that have transferred cargo in the last 50 days) increases the company rating. To place a station, the company must have a minimum rating of -200 (Poor).

Use the [[en/Manual/Land area information]] tool to find out which local authority a tile belongs to (if any).

==通过NewGRF更改城镇==
Town buildings can be modified and/or replaced by NewGRF sets.  NewGRF sets are available offering a range of changes, from adding just a building or two, up to total town replacement.  NewGRF sets can also redefine which cargos are accepted and produced by town buildings.  NewGRF sets can also provide new or modified industries which locate in or near towns.

==“神奇推土机”作弊指令==
如果 [[zh/Manual/作弊指令#shen-qi-tui-tu-ji|神奇推土机]] 作弊选项启用，工业设施有概率会被正在扩展的城市意外地拆除。为保险起见，使用此作弊指令时请先启用它，然后在做完要做的事情之后记得禁用它。

==城镇道路网建设==
The town will automatically construct roads as the town expands. It will always lay crossroad every two or three tiles as long as there is flat land. (sloped roads cannot be crossed by others) In some cases, three or more town buildings may be built along a straight road (on the flat land). However, as the town expands, it may demolish one of those buildings to make way for the new road that extends from the crossroad (even the road only extends one tile forward from the junction). 

Obviously if a player wants the town to expand more efficiently, building player-owned roads and intersections for the town is required. It involves building the latitudinal and longitudinal roads every three tiles around the town like checkers, leaving four tiles of each block for the town building to be constructed. If the crossroads spread more than two tiles away, the town will persistently construct the crossroads on the player's own road between the existing crossroads.
