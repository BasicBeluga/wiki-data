{{zh/Manual/目录}}

[[zh/Manual/Main Page|OpenTTD]]拥有比原版<span class="plainlinks">[http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/運輸大亨 Transport Tycoon Deluxe (运输大亨)]</span>好得多的多人游戏系统。

[[zh/Manual/服务器]]现在可以容纳最多15家公司，最多255个客户端同时连接。你既可以运营你自己的公司，也可以与其他玩家[[en/Community/Play Style/Cooperative gameplay|合作游玩(en)]]。

如果你仍然无法补全一些缺失的NewGRF，可以用 [http://grfcrawler.tt-forums.net/ GRF Crawler] 搜索。

==进入游戏==
In the next screen you will see a detailed list of who is already in the game, and several options on how to join the game.
[[File:en/Manual/Ottdmulti5.png|none|frame|Join multiplayer game]]
*Click "New company" to start playing from scratch, OR
*Select a company without a lock icon and click "Join company" to play for that company, OR
*Click "Watch Game" to enter the game as a spectator.


The company list on the left shows the following information:
*'''Company Name'''
*'''Lock Icon''': The company is private and protected with a password.
*'''Red/Green Light''': Shows if there is still a connected client playing for that company.


==游玩==
Once you are in the game, gameplay is the same with a few extra features.

Note that the game may pause sometimes. This can happen while new players join the game, when there are less than the minimum active clients, or when the server administrator or Game Script manually pauses the game. If the game is paused that is displayed as usually in the status bar. The reason appears in the message area at the bottom left of the screen. You can't change the pause state as a client. Nobody can use the fast forward mode.

===聊天===
[[File:en/Manual/Ottdmulti9.png|center|frame|3. The Chat Display Area]]
*Start chatting by pressing Enter.  A text entry window will open above the status bar.
*Change who you talk to by using the client list; see below.
*Chat and connection messages display in the bottom left of the screen. Players text is the color of their company. Spectators' text is gray. 
*Open the [[en/Manual/Console]] to see message history.
*SHIFT+ENTER (SHIFT+T) sends a message to all players, CTRL+ENTER (CTRL+T) sends a message to all team mates and ENTER (T) is customizable

===在线玩家列表===
[[File:en/Manual/Ottdmulti7.png|none|frame|The client list]]
*Open the company list [[File:en/Manual/Manual html 12e20f5b.png]] menu and click "Client list" to see which clients are connected and what company they are playing for.
*Click on a client to open another menu with the following options:
:*'''Private Message''': Send a chat message to only the selected client.
:*'''Speak to company''': Send a chat message to everyone in the selected client's company.
:*'''Speak to all''': Send a chat message to everyone.
:*'''Give money''': Give up to £20,000,000 to the selected client's company.

The client list also tells who the server is. If the server has a name next to it, that person is running a [[en/Archive/Manual/Listen server]]. If the server has no name to it, then it is a [[en/Manual/Dedicated server|dedicated server]].

===公司密码===
[[File:en/Manual/Company password input box2.png|none|frame|Enter your password here]]
*To prevent unwanted clients from joining your company, click the company list button and then the password button.  Enter your password here.
*To remove your password, set the password to nothing.
*You have to set your password on every server.

==在不同公司间切换==
As of OpenTTD 0.7.0 (or more precise since r15242) it is possible to move between companies/spectator and create new companies without having to rejoin the game

===新建公司===
You can find the 'New Company' option in the company list, it is only available if you are a spectator. If the servers 'max_companies' limit has been reached, this option is grayed out
[[File:en/Manual/Move company create.png|none|frame|company list as spectator]]

===加入公司===
Every company window has a join button (only displayed if you are not in that company).
[[File:en/Manual/Move company join.png|none|frame|company join button]]
A padlock displayed next to the join button indicates the company is password protected. Trying to join this company will prompt you for the password.
[[File:en/Manual/Move company join pwprompt.png|none|frame|password protected company + pw prompt]]

===加入旁观者===
If you are in a company and want to spectate for a little, or plan to start a new company and must join spectators first, the company list now shows the item 'Spectate' where the 'New Company' item was listed before.
If the servers 'max_spectators' limit has been reached, this option is grayed out.

==Desync error==
A desync error occurs when one or more players move out of sync with the server. After a short while, the player will be ejected from the game with the following message:

[[File:en/Manual/Desync.png]]

Desyncs are always bugs in OpenTTD, which can be put into three classes: calling <code>(Interactive)Random()</code> in the wrong place, not rebuilding caches correctly, or coding errors like overflows. They are NOT caused by a too slow computer, too slow internet connection etc.

See [[en/Archive/Source/OpenTTDDevBlackBook/Network/Desync debugging|Desync Debugging]] on how you can help to track and identify the bug.
