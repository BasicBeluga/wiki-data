隧道用于穿越大山，城市或工业设施，因为无法在这些上面架设桥梁．它们也可用于穿越交汇点，因为车辆通过它们时不会象桥梁那样减速．

==建造隧道==
你可以用建造铁路和公路的方式建造相应两种隧道. 隧道里的路不能移除，但你仍可以在不同的铁路类型间转换．
* 点击'''铁路隧道''' 按钮 [[File:en/Manual/Build traintunnel.png]] 或　'''公路隧道''' 按钮 [[File:en/Manual/Build roadtunnel.png]]．
* 寻找合适的建造地点．不能在平地上建造隧道，只有在隆起地形的两边斜坡上．

* 确认后点击斜面建造隧道．

==Advanced tunnel building==
If you want to tunnel somewhere that does not slope in the right place or direction, you will have to either raise or lower land to correct it and allow a tunnel to be built.

If there is a slope in an odd direction at the end of the tunnel, it will be automatically lowered so that the tunnel can be dug. However, you can't start digging the tunnel at such a slope; you must terraform it first.
[[File:en/Manual/Tunnel prepare second.png|none|frame|Tunnel construction is possible even if it ends at an oddly-directed slope]]
[[File:en/Manual/Tunnel built second.png|none|frame|The slope will be automatically lowered in order to dig a tunnel]]

Sometimes, the odd directed slope can't be lowered automatically because of obstacles on surrounding tiles. You will see an error window saying so. 
[[File:en/Manual/Tunnel terraform third.png|none|frame|Automatic slope lowering is impossible]]
[[File:en/Manual/Tunnel error third.png|none|frame|The error message appears]]

Raise the land manually, so the tunnel end tile is a flat slope.

==Limitations==
* Tunnels cannot cross each other underground - you will be warned about it if you try.  Also, you will be prevented from excavating the landscape from above if there is a tunnel underneath. However, there is a [[en/Archive/Manual/Crossing tunnels|cheat]] that allows you to build crossing tunnels. With the cheat on, trains ''can'' cross other trains, also.
* You cannot place signals inside railway tunnels so you may not have more than one train in a tunnel at once.  Very long tunnels can therefore slow down your rail networks.
* It appears that there is increased friction (whether with air or rail is unknown) when a train is travelling through a tunnel. A train can go faster outside of a tunnel than it can inside. (Note: This may be due to realistic acceleration - did not test.)
