= 手动替换 =
你可以按以下步骤在不丢失调度计划的情况下替换单个车辆：
#将想要替换的车辆送回车库
#出售该车辆（只出售车头，如果是列车的话）
#*现在，你购买的 ''第一个'' 新车辆/车头获得你刚出售车辆相同的调度计划
#购买你想要的车辆/车头（它会获得你刚出售车辆的调度计划）

= 自动替换 =


自动替换是一个能让你将一整组特定类型车辆升级为另一种的功能，让你不用单独手动替换它们。比如当你刚刚组建了一个有40辆车的公交网，紧接着新的公交车面市了，如果手动将那些公交送回车库，卖掉，再买新的，会花费大量的时间和精力，这时就是应该使用自动替换的时候了。你可以将一种列车型号全部换成另一种，车厢同样也可以更换。更换车厢功能在那些随游戏进程引入新的，更快的车厢的 [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] 中十分有用。（如果你想要将老旧车辆翻新，请另行使用 [[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles]] 中的自动更新）

要打开 ''替换载具'' 窗口， 首先打开你想要替换载具的载具列表（下面截图以列车的为例）。点击 ''管理列表'' ，在菜单中选择 ''替换载具'' 。
[[File:en/Manual/ManageList.png|frame|none|''替换载具'' 在哪]]

''替换（载具类型）'' 窗口就会出现，与下图为列车的窗口看起来差不多。
[[File:en/Manual/ReplaceTrain.png|frame|none|列车的 ''替换载具'' 窗口]]

窗口左边展示的载具是你当前使用的，右边的是可供升级的载具。在左边选定要替换的载具，右边选定新载具来指定替换方向。

如果你在替换列车，且现在有多种类型列车可用，你可以用窗口底部中间的菜单按钮来切换类型（上图显示 ''电力机车（Electrified Rail Vehicles）'' 的地方）。对于列车，可以点击上图展示的 ''Replacing: Engines'' 来切换更换车头和更换车厢。

Naturally it is not possible to upgrade between different types of train because the train would need to be able to enter a depot and leave as a new type.  The exception to this rule is upgrading from normal to electric trains (if you have electrified rails in place) since both will run on electrified rails and can be built from electrified depots.

To begin replacing vehicles once you have made a selection, you click ''Start Replacing Vehicles''.

Once all vehicles of a type have been replaced, the old vehicle type will turn grey in the replace vehicles window (as the ''Floss 47'' is showing then).  Click on it and click ''Stop Replacing Vehicles'' to complete the procedure and it will then disappear from the list.

==移除车箱==
In the bottom-right corner of the replace vehicles window is a button labelled  ''Wagon removal on/off''. If this option is set to ''on'', then when a 1-unit engine (for example, the Gresley A4) is replaced with a 2-unit engine (the IC125 for example), the first carriage in the train will be sold to maintain the original length of the train. 

Note that this only works one way; if you were to replace a train with two engines (e.g. IC125 or some DMUs) with a single engined train, you would shorten the overall length. It is not padded back up to the original length because you cannot specify which carriage would be used to do that.

==保养==
Once you select "start Replacing" the game will replace the vehicle on it's next arrival at a depot for maintenance; however this does not automatically give vehicles an order to report to a depot for maintenance.

If you would like to upgrade all of the vehicles immediately instead, you can issue an order to the vehicles in question to report for maintenance by using the "Send [Vehicles] for Maintenance" option on the Vehicle manager window for the group of vehicles you selected to upgrade, or for a sub-group of those vehicles if you create one yourself. In addition you can also manually schedule individual vehicles this way by clicking each vehicle's "Send to Depot" button.

The above method is especially useful when you play with the ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Advanced Settings/Vehicles#disable-servicing-when-breakdowns-set-to-none|Disable servicing when breakdowns set to none]]'' option enabled and ''[[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Difficulty#vehicle-breakdowns|Vehicle breakdowns]]'' are set to ''None'', as the trains will not be serviced automatically.

Autoreplace's list of vehicals to replace the one selected will filter itself so only vehicles matching these requirements are shown:
** They may be refitted to the proper cargo. (Generally only applies to ships/road/air)
** They travel on the same type of infrastructure. (ie. Ships on water, mag-levs on mag-lev track, vehicals on roads, Helecopter on Helipad, etc.)

In Open TTD 1.0 and higher Auto Replace will use different rules to replace vehicles depending on your funds:
* The company needs to have more money than (autoreplace money limit) + 2 * (price for new vehicles).
** Auto Replace does not consider the sell price of old vehicles.
** The auto replace money limit is the same limit as the Autorenew minimum needed money configured in Advanced Settings.
