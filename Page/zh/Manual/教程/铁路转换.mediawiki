==转换铁路==
要选择转换的铁道类型，点击并按住'''主工具条菜单'''的'''铁路建设'''按钮，会显示铁道类型选项．
[[File:en/Manual/Convert rail menu.png|600px]]<br/>
选择一个选项后，下列工具条之一会显示：
[[File:en/Manual/Railroad Construction.png|none|frame|标准铁道建设工具条]]
[[File:en/Manual/Electrified Railway Construction.png|none|frame|电气化铁道建设工具条]]
[[File:en/Manual/Monorail Construction.png|none|frame|单轨铁道建设工具条]]
[[File:en/Manual/Maglev Construction.png|none|frame|磁悬浮铁道建设工具条]]
然后点击　'''转换所有'''　按钮[[File:en/Manual/Convert rail.png]] 在已建好的轨道上拖动并释放．此工具可用于　'''铁轨'''　'''车库'''　'''桥梁'''　'''隧道'''　'''车站'''和 '''路点'''．
*桥梁和隧道：点击它的一端．
*车站：必须转换每一格站台．不然可能搞混车站内的铁道类型 ([[en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Nonuniform stations|Nonuniform stations]]).
*确认铁轨上没有火车．运行中的火车请送入车库
* Be sure that the line is free from trains. Trains you already have running should be sent to the depot and then [[en/Manual/Sell entire train|sold]] (except when you convert from [[en/Manual/Base Set/Railways|normal railway]] to [[en/Manual/Base Set/Electrified railways|electrified railway]]).

* You can convert rails under trains from [[en/Manual/Base Set/Railways|normal railway]] to [[en/Manual/Base Set/Electrified railways|electrified railway]]. It doesn't need to be empty.

* You can convert only to those types that are available.

==Diagonal tracks==
In OpenTTD there can be only one type of track on each tile (except the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Railways|normal railway]] and [[en/Manual/Base Set/Electrified railways|electrified railway]]) so it is possible that you have to rebuild your railways first if you would like to mix the type of your close diagonal railway lines.

==Tips==
* To save time converting a train with lots of orders from one railtype to another, send your train to a depot of the old type and [[en/Manual/Sell entire train|sell it]]. While the depot window is still open, convert the depot to the new railtype, and the next train you build will have all the orders of your previous train. The depot window must remain open throughout this operation. Note that you can only convert one train at a time using this method, but you may also convert the empty depot back to the old railtype so you can convert another train using the same depot.

* For converting to a compatible railtype (e.g. [[en/Manual/Base Set/Electrified railways|electrified railway]]), updating trains is not immediately necessary as steam and diesel trains run perfectly on electrified rails.  Electrified trains, however, will not pass over non-electrified tiles.

* Vehicle replacement ([[en/Manual/Replace vehicles#autoreplace|Autoreplace]]) doesn't work cross-depot.

* You can use the [[en/Manual/Orders#go-to|go to depot]] order for all trains that use the line you would like to convert or use the vehicle list where you can send all (or grouped) trains to the nearest depot.
