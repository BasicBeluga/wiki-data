在OpenTTD游戏中总共有四种'''气候'''（游戏环境）：''温带''、''亚热带''、''亚寒带''与''玩具大陆''。每一种游戏环境都有自己的地形图象与各自不同的[[zh/Manual/载具]]、[[zh/Manual/工业]]与[[en/Manual/Towns|城镇(en)]]的组合。环境同样影响游戏的其他特性，比如城镇的需求。

==温带气候==

[[File:en/Manual/Temperatescreenshot.png|thumb|left|300px|温带气候]]

温带气候最早可以追溯到1994年的原版运输大亨游戏。它基于TTD的开发者们：Chris Sawyer、Simon Foster与John Broomhall居住的英国。这也体现在交通工具上，这个环境中大部分的交通工具都是在英国随处可见的。同样地，游戏中的许多建筑物都基于Chris Sawyer的故乡——格拉斯哥（苏格兰最大城市）的现实建筑。

温带气候是最受欢迎的游戏环境，因为它提供了最丰富的内容与最快的列车。这同样反映在[[zh/Manual/NewGRF]]模组中。最受人们喜爱的两个模组：[[en/Community/NewGRF/UK Renewal Set|英国重制组件(en)]]与[[en/Community/NewGRF/DBSet|德国铁路（Deutsche Bahn）组件(en)]]均只能运行在温带气候。温带气候包含了价值最高的货物——煤炭，因此很可能是最容易盈利的。

The temperate climate is the most popular climate, as it features the highest variety of and fastest trains. This is also reflected in [[en/Manual/NewGRF]] sets, the two most popular being the [[en/Community/NewGRF/UK Renewal Set]] and the [[en/Community/NewGRF/DBSet]] which work exclusively in the temperate climate. The climate also has one of the highest valued goods, coal, and is arguably the easiest to make money in. Unlike the sub-climates, there are no requirements of food or water for any towns to grow and very few restrictions as to where industries can be located. By default, this is the only climate to contain electric trains and multiple unit railcars.

[[File:en/Manual/Subarcticscreenshot.png|thumb|right|300px|Sub-arctic climate]]
The sub-arctic climate was added in Transport Tycoon Deluxe in 1995 with Sub-Tropical and Toyland. It is based in North America, most probably Canada. This is shown in the style of the trains available and the fact that the town names are still British-based (since Canada is a Commonwealth country). 

The most striking feature of Sub-Arctic is the snow above a certain line. Naturally, every building and tree above the snowline also appears covered in snow. There are separate graphics in the Sub-Arctic climate from Temperate and Sub-tropical, but many graphics are re-used, namely the graphics for infrastructure. In Sub-Arctic, there are new industry chains available, including the paper chain and the new food cargo which must be delivered to towns above the snowline to enable them to grow. A slight difference from the Temperate climate is the fact that Forests must be located above the snowline. Sub-Arctic is also a popular climate to play in, but not to the extent of the Temperate climate due to the low choices in [[en/Manual/Trains]]. There are no electric trains in Sub-Arctic, and it shares its locomotives with the Sub-Tropical climate. There are replacement sets for this climate, notably the [[en/Community/NewGRF/North American Renewal Set]].

[[File:en/Manual/Subtropicalscreenshot.png|thumb|300px|left|Sub-tropical climate]]
The Sub-tropical climate was also introduced with Transport Tycoon Deluxe. It is based in Latin America, according to the town names and the choice of [[en/Manual/Trains]] available. 

This climate has lush rainforests where there is grass growing near water locations, yet barren deserts with cacti where there is no water. Towns located in the desert require food and water to grow, the first of which can be produced by [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Food Processing Plant]]s and the other by [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Water Supply|Water Sources]] in the desert which must be delivered to a [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Water Tower]]. There are quite a few restrictions as to where industries may be placed, most notably Food Processing Plants and Agriculture which must be placed in grassland, [[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Lumber Mill]]s must be surrounded by Rainforest and Water Sources are only found in the desert. A peculiarity unique to the Sub-tropical is the Lumber Mill, which can only be funded by the player and cuts down trees in the vicinity. If the industry runs out of resources, trees must be replanted by the player. One of the original scenarios from Transport Tycoon Deluxe called "Megarail 1960" was a tropical scenario which taught players about networked railways.

The Sub-tropical climate is not as popular as the temperate climate as the choice of trains in Sub-tropical is the same as it was in Sub-arctic. There is also only one steam locomotive available in the sub-climates.

[[File:en/Manual/Toylandscreenshot.png|thumb|right|300px|Toyland climate]]

Toyland is a completely fictional climate containing surreal graphics, emulating a child's world.

Candy and sweets represent buildings and trees, as well as toys replacing goods and trains. Every single graphic in Toyland is new, including roads and rail. The roads simulate a toy race track, while the railways have larger sleepers. All vehicles have silly sounds and faces drawn on them. There is very little choice of vehicles, with only basics provided with low horsepower. 

Toyland is the least liked climate of OpenTTD due to its bright and jarring colours, as well as its overall cheesyness and clichés. This has lead to numerous attempts to reform the climate into a Mars landscape (below), and it will almost certainly be omitted from 32bpp graphics versions of OpenTTD when they are released. All factories and goods are replaced with surreal ones, such as a "[[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Toffee Quarry]]" and "[[en/Manual/Base Set/Industries/Battery Farm]]". The earliest possible starting year for any vehicle is 1935.
