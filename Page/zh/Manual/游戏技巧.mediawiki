这个页面记录了许多OpenTTD游戏的实用技巧。

*Press Shift while performing an action (e.g. laying track, buying a bridge or tunnel) to see how much it would cost without actually doing it. (Note: This can be a long way off with the level land tool sometimes - normally says it will cost like £50,000 instead of £25,000 or something)

*Press ''x'' to enable or disable trees and buildings transparency.

*利用好[[zh/Manual/教程/调度任务]]。如果你有多辆运行在同一路线上的客车（或者其他交通工具），你明白可以通过先点击无调度计划车辆的调度计划按钮，然后再点击已有欲复制调度计划的车辆来复制调度计划到其他车辆。但是你知道么——如果你在点击车辆的时候同时按住Ctrl键，两辆车辆会共享同一套调度计划，之后你如果想改变调度计划（比分说把这些车辆改向另一个车站），每一辆“共享调度计划”的车辆都会自动改变运行路线。<!--Use "[[en/Manual/Orders]]".  If you have more than one bus (or any other vehicle) travelling the same route, you know that you can copy the orders from one of the vehicles onto another by clicking the orders button and then the vehicle that has the orders you want to copy...  But did you know that if you press Ctrl when you click the vehicle, both vehicles will share the same set of orders so that if you ever need to change the orders (e.g. you need to send them both to another new station), every vehicle with those "Shared Orders" will see the change as well.-->

*Try to make sure that any inner-city road vehicle stations are within a loop of road.  A road vehicle station can only take two vehicles at a time... any more and they will try to "go around the block" and come back to the station.  If your station is inside a loop of road then they can circle the town and return when the station is clear.  If not, they might wander off miles out of their way!

*随着游戏进行，记得升级更新你的桥梁。在游戏一开始的时候，便宜的桥梁既能满足需求又能省下很多钱；然而一旦有新的、更结实的桥梁出现之后，你完全没有理由非得让320km/h(200mph)的火车降速到32km/h(20mph)就为了过一个摇摇晃晃的老木桥！

*注意交通工具是如何服务站点的。尽管把所有的交通工具（汽车、火车、飞机、船舶）都放在一个站点可以让你处理大规模的客货流，但请确保不要把值钱的货物从赚钱“养车糊口”的长路线上运走。<!--Be careful how you serve some of your stations.  Although putting everything you can get (buses, trains, planes, ships) into one station means that you can handle a large amount of passengers or goods traffic, make sure that you are careful not to take the goodies away from that money-generating long route that's been keeping you going. -->有时候，几辆汽车就可以运光一个站点，之后的火车要满载就得等到天荒地老。<!--Sometimes, a few buses can empty a station so that a train can take forever to build up a full load.-->

*距离很重要。运输距离越远，每次运输的收入越多。但是要小心……同时你也越可能被跑前跑后的对手抢先运走货物，然后搞得一脸懵B。<!--请理解本土化翻译:-)-->

*速度也很重要。运输速度越快，每次运输的收入越多，可运输的货物也会越多。在某些情况下，速度翻番，吞吐量也会翻番，然而利润将会增至三倍！

*尽量别惹恼当地政府。在同一市区的大量建筑工作可能会让当地政府对你恼火，而这会影响你在城镇及其周边能做什么。为避免出现麻烦，试着随着时间推移慢慢进行工作，限制每次破坏建筑的量，在周边种上树来暗渡陈仓，甚至在极端情况下用贿赂买通他们！<!--Try not to upset the locals.  Lots of building work in an area can make the local authorities mad with you.  This can affect what you can do in nearby towns.  Try to compensate by making changes over time, limiting the amount of damage you do, planting them some nice trees to hide the building work or even, in extreme cases, bribing the town in question!-->

*Try not to make parallel tracks too close, unless they are doing the same job.  If you use two different tracks that are so close that the horizontal and vertical track sections share the same square, make sure you realise the consequences.  When it comes to upgrading to monorail or maglev tracks, you'll have to upgrade both tracks at the same time or reroute one of them so that they don't share the same square.

*你的总部也会产出少量的乘客/邮件。在游戏早期你需要提升人口稀少城镇内的收入时，这一点会很有用。<!--This might be handy in the early stages of the game to boost your earnings in a sparse town.  -->与原版“运输大亨豪华版”(TTD)不同，OpenTTD允许你以一定的价钱重置总部，因此你可以在城镇开始扩展之后把总部移走。<!--Unlike the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe, OpenTTD lets you relocate the HQ (for a certain price) so that you can move it away once the town starts to expand.-->

*避免修建90度角的尖角铁路弯道，因为列车通过这种弯道时的速度不能超过88km/h(55mph)，而且部分服务器不允许列车90度转弯。尽量拉长转弯之间的距离，以能让列车全速通过弯道。<!--Try not to build sharp 90 degree turns as trains can only do 55MPH around them and some servers do not allow trains to go around such corners. Instead try to make your turns as wide as possible to allow trains to go at full speed around them.-->

*如果你想用小价钱来建造运河，试试[[en/Community/Pseudo canals|伪运河法(en)]]。<!--
to lower the land to sea level without exposing it to water.  Then, when the canal path is formed, you only need to open up the canal to the existing body(ies) of water.  Water will "flood" into the space and the canal will be formed.
If ships can't come somewhere and canals are too expensive. Try making a polder (like the dutch) and flood them. Just lower one point in the middle of the land to sea floor level and expand to a plane till a canal is formed but no water is present. Then make an opening into the sea and after a few years you have a canal only much cheaper and bridges can be build without the need for elevation.-->

*贿赂地方政府要花很多钱，而且有时候会被揭发。尽可能在城镇周围多种树以提升你的评价。

*<!--If you want to build train stations near to towns/cities, it is good to connect them with an airport. As you can see on the picture, airports are able to spread their influence much more than train stations, so you get many more passengers and much more mail. -->如果你想要在城镇附近修建火车站，让它紧邻机场是个好主意。<small>（译者注：就像上海虹桥枢纽那样。）</small>如你所见，机场的覆盖范围比火车站大得多，所以你可以接受更大的客流和更多的邮件。[[File:en/Manual/Train vs Airport station.png|thumb|600px|center|Train station connected with airport]]

*如果你开启了加强版固定资产维护，只保留运输需要的基础设施。移除任何不再需要的基础设施。只在必要的时候使用双轨复线铁路。考虑每6-10格才放置信号灯，而不是每2-5格就放置。利用城镇和对手拥有的道路，而不是直接自己建造道路。

*Remember to make sure to use fast vehicles, have frequent pickups, keep waiting cargo low, and buy a town statue. All of these improve your station ratings, which are key to increasing industry production and cargo throughput.
