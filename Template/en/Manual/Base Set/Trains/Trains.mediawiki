==Description==
This is usually the first electric locomotive available to a player in the game. It isn't any faster than the [[en/Manual/Base Set/Trains/Floss '47']] diesel locomotive, but it's  lighter by 28 t, and more powerful with an additional 1080 hp.  Therefore, it's an immediate improvement, and usually a good choice for longer, slower trains.
